What is the primary function of locks in the context of processor synchronization?,"['To prevent data corruption by ensuring only one process accesses shared resources concurrently.', 'To accelerate processing speed by allowing multiple processors to access critical sections simultaneously.', 'To manage the order of execution of processes to avoid deadlocks.', 'To measure the synchronization overhead in a multi-processor system.']",A,"Locks are used to protect critical sections of code, ensuring that only one processor can access and modify shared resources at a time, thereby preventing data corruption and race conditions.",Classical Problems of Synchronization,Easy,7.5
Which of the following is an example of an atomic operation used in synchronization?,"['Semaphore signaling', 'Barrier synchronization', 'Test-and-set', 'Deadlock detection']",C,"Test-and-set is a hardware-supported atomic operation that is commonly used for synchronization. It allows a processor to test the value of a memory location and set it atomically, ensuring no interruption.",Classical Problems of Synchronization,Easy,7.5
"In a multi-processor system, what does the term ""synchronization overhead"" refer to?","['The time required for a single processor to complete its task.', 'The additional time spent coordinating the actions of multiple processors.', 'The time taken for data transfer between processors.', 'The time spent resolving deadlocks.']",B,"Synchronization overhead represents the extra time consumed in coordinating and synchronizing the execution of multiple processors, which is not part of the actual computational work.",Classical Problems of Synchronization,Medium,7.5
Barriers in processor synchronization are used to:,"['Prevent deadlocks by ordering processes.', 'Ensure all processors reach a specific point before proceeding.', 'Manage the allocation of shared resources among processors.', 'Measure the performance of individual processors.']",B,"Barriers are synchronization mechanisms that force all participating processors to pause until all have reached the barrier point, ensuring synchronization before proceeding to the next phase.",Classical Problems of Synchronization,Easy,7.5
"A formula involving  'T<sub>synch</sub>' (synchronization overhead), 'n' (number of processors), and execution time is used to calculate:","['The maximum processing speed achievable.', 'The total execution time of a parallel program.', ""The individual processor's execution time."", 'The synchronization overhead percentage.']",B,"The formula mentioned in the passage relates the synchronization overhead, the number of processors, and individual execution times to calculate the total synchronized execution time of a parallel program.",Classical Problems of Synchronization,Medium,7.5

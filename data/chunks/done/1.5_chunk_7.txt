However, the accuracy of LC oscillators can be affected by the tolerance of the 
components used.
Basic Principles of Crystal Oscillators Circuits
Crystal oscillators utilize the piezoelectric properties of quartz crystals to 
generate highly stable and accurate frequencies. When a crystal is subjected to 
an electric field, it vibrates mechanically at a natural frequency determined by 
its physical dimensions and cut.

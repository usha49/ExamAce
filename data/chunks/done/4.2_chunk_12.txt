Write-through policy updates both the cache and main memory 
simultaneously, ensuring consistency but increasing latency. Write-back policy 
updates the main memory only when the cached data is replaced, reducing write 
operations but requiring additional control mechanisms to maintain consistency.
 
Number of caches
Modern CPUs often include multiple levels of cache (L1, L2, and sometimes L3) to 
optimize performance. L1 cache is the fastest but smallest, located closest to 
the CPU.

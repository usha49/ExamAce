closing an already closed expression does not change the language 
• 
Ø* = e 
• 
e* = e 
• 
L+ = LL* = L*L    – more of a definition than a law 
• 
L* = L+  + e 
• 
L? = e + L – more of a definition than a law 
 
Checking a Law 
Suppose we are told that the law (R + S)* = (R*S*)* holds for regular expressions. How would we check 
that this claim is true? 
1. Convert the RE’s to DFA’s and minimize the DFA’s to see if they are equivalent  
2.

δ : δ1 ∪ δ2 ∪ { (q0, e, q1), (q0, e, q2)}    is defined as follows:  
For any r ∈ K and for any a ∈  

δ (r, a) = δ1(r, a)  
if r ∈ K1 
 
= δ2(r, a)  
if r ∈ K2 
 
= {q1, q2 }    
if r = q0 and a = e 
= ø   if r = q0 and a ≠ e 
Steps in Union of L1 and L2 
 Create a new start state 
 Make a e-transition from the new start state to each of the original start states.

They are configured in three common modes:
Common Emitter: Provides high gain and is widely used in amplification.
Common Base: Offers low input impedance and high-frequency operation.
Common Collector (Emitter Follower): Used for impedance matching due to high 
input and low output impedance.
Proper biasing is critical to ensure that the BJT operates in the desired 
region. This involves applying a DC voltage or current to the base terminal 
relative to the emitter and collector.

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are 
widely used symmetric encryption algorithms. DES uses a 56-bit key and performs multiple rounds of 
substitution and permutation to secure data. AES, an improvement over DES, supports key lengths of 
128, 192, and 256 bits, providing stronger security. 
Asymmetric encryption algorithms such as RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) use two keys: a public key for 
encryption and a private key for decryption.

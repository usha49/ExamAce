When the environment is partially observable,
the agent uses its internal model to fill in the gaps about
unobservable parts.
The model describes how the environment evolves (state transition)
and how the agentâ€™s actions affect the environment.
Key Characteristics:
Maintains an internal state.
Uses a model of the environment to predict unobservable aspects.
Suitable for partially observable environments.
Updates the internal state continuously as it perceives and acts.
Goal Based,
Goal-based agents choose actions by considering future consequences
and select actions that achieve specific goals.
Unlike reflex agents, they evaluate the desirability of different
sequences of actions rather than reacting to individual percepts.
A goal is a desired state of the environment.

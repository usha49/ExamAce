Each instruction executed by the 
microprocessor consists of a sequence of binary operations that manipulate data, perform calculations, 
or control hardware devices. 
The fundamental components of a computer system include memory, input and output devices, and a 
central processing unit. The introduction of microprocessors revolutionized computing by integrating 
these functions into a single chip, reducing system size, increasing processing speed, and lowering 
power consumption.

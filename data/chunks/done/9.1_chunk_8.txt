Neuroscience as the Foundation of AI
Neuroscience studies the structure and function of the human brain.
AI research, particularly in neural networks, draws inspiration from
the biological processes of neurons.
Key Concepts:
Neurons and synapses.
Neural firing patterns.
Brain plasticity and learning.
AI Applications:
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) mimic the human brain's structure.
Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize
patterns in large datasets.
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) attempt to model more biologically
accurate neural behavior.

Framing involves taking packets from the network layer and 
encapsulating them into frames, then sending each frame bit-by-bit on the hardware. At the receiver's 
end, the data link layer picks up signals from the hardware and assembles them into frames. Addressing 
is provided through a layer-2 hardware addressing mechanism, with a unique hardware address 
encoded into the hardware at the time of manufacturing.

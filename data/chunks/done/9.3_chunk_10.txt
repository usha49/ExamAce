Propositional Logic (PL)
Syntax
Basic elements: Propositions (e.g., PP, QQ).
Logical connectives: ∧∧(AND), ∨∨(OR), ¬¬ (NOT), →→(IMPLIES).
Semantics
Truth tables define the meaning of logical expressions.
Key Concepts
Tautology: A statement that is always true (e.g., P∨¬PP∨¬P).
Validity: A statement that is true under all interpretations.

Well-Formed Formula (WFF): A syntactically correct logical expression.
Inference using Resolution
A rule of inference used in automated theorem proving.
Example: Resolving P∨QP∨Q and ¬P∨R¬P∨R to infer Q∨RQ∨R.

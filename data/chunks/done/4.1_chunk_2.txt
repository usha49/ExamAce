Control memory is typically 
implemented using ROM or RAM, with ROM being non-volatile and used for fixed 
microprograms, while RAM allows flexibility in modifying the control sequences. 
Efficient control memory design is crucial for ensuring quick instruction 
decoding and execution in a CPU.
 Addressing sequencing
Addressing sequencing is the process by which a CPU determines the sequence of 
memory addresses to access during program execution.

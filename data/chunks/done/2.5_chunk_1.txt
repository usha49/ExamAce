Memory Device Classification and Hierarchy 
Memory devices play a crucial role in a microprocessor-based system by storing instructions and data. 
The classification of memory is based on factors such as access speed, volatility, and function. Broadly, 
memory is classified into primary memory, secondary memory, and cache memory. 
Primary memory consists of RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory). RAM is a 
volatile memory, meaning data is lost when the system is powered off.

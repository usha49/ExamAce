Basic Principles of Oscillator 
An oscillator is an electronic device that generates periodic waveforms without 
requiring an input signal. The fundamental principle of oscillation lies in the 
positive feedback mechanism, where a portion of the output is fed back to the 
input in phase to sustain continuous operation. Oscillators are classified based 
on the type of waveform they produce, such as sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal 
(square, triangular, or sawtooth).

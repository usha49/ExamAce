The SIGNED type supports signed arithmetic, while UNSIGNED is for non-negative 
numbers.
Example of using signed numbers in VHDL:
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
use IEEE.NUMERIC_STD.ALL;
signal A, B, Result: SIGNED(7 downto 0);
Result <= A + B; -- Signed addition
Design of combinational and sequential logic using VHDL

VHDL enables the design of both combinational and sequential circuits:
Combinational Logic:
Combinational circuits have outputs that depend solely on the current inputs.

of
comparisons= O(n2)No. of Interchanges:This cannot be greater than no. of comparisons,In the
best case, there are no interchanges,In the worst case, this equals no of comparisons.The
average and worse case running time of bubble sort is O(n2).It is actually the no of interchanges
which takes up most time of the programâ€™s execution than the no of comparisons.When
elements are large and interchange operation is expensive, it is better to maintain an array of
pointers to the elements.

Nondeterministic finite automaton can be a much more convenient device to design than a 
deterministic finite automaton, 
Formal Definition : A nondeterministic finite automaton is a quintuple M = (K, ∑, ∆, s, F), where
K is a finite set of states, 
∑  is an alphabet, 
s є K is the initial state, 
F  K is the set of final states, and 
∆, the transition relation, is a subset of K x (∑  {e}) x K. 
NFA is a variant of finite automaton with two capabilities

Biasing methods include fixed bias, 
voltage-divider bias, and emitter bias, each suited for specific applications to 
stabilize the transistor's operation.
Small and large signal model
The small-signal model of a BJT simplifies the analysis of its behavior in 
amplifying weak signals. It uses equivalent circuit parameters, such as 
transconductance and output resistance, to represent the transistor's linear 
region of operation.

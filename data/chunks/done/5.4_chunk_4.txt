At the transport layer, an address is needed to choose among multiple processes running on the 
destination host called Port Number. A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link 
between two processes running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP 
layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent.

A TCP uses a 3-way handshaking mechanism to establish the connection between the nodes.

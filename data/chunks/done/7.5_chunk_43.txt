In some systems when a process kills all processes it
created are killed as well (UNIX does not work this way).
Process State (Two state model) : In this model, we consider two main states of the
process. These two states are State 1: Process is Running on CPU ,State 2: Process
is Not Running on CPU . New: First of all, when a new process is created, then it is in
Not Running State. Suppose a new process P2 is created then P2 is in NOT Running
State.

Let  G= (V, ∑, R, S) be a CFG, we must construct a PDA M such that L(M) = L(G) . The 
machine we construct has only two states p and q and remains permanently in state q after its 
first move. Also M uses V : set of terminals and ∑ set of non terminals as its stack alphabet.  
Let  M= (K, ∑, Г ,∆ , S , F) where  
K = {p, q} 
∑= ∑ 
Г= V  ∑  
S=p and    
∆ ( transition relation) is defined as  
1. ((p, e ,e), (q, S))   as S is starting non terminals of CFG.

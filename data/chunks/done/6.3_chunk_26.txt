We construct a new Turing machine that emulates 
both T1 and T2, alternating moves between them. When either one stops, we can tell (by whether 
it accepted or rejected the string) to which language the string belongs. 
Thus, we have constructed a Turing machine that, for each input, halts with an answer whether 
or not the string belongs to L. Therefore L and -L are recursive languages.

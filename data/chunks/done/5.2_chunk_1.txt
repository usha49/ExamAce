The Data Link Layer is the second layer of the OSI Layered Model. It ensures that an initial connection 
has been set up, divides output data into data frames, and handles the acknowledgements from a 
receiver that the data arrived successfully. It is responsible for converting a data stream to signals bit by 
bit and sending them over the underlying hardware.

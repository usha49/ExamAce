This characteristic makes CMOS the 
preferred technology for integrated circuits, particularly in digital 
applications. The low static power dissipation and high noise immunity of CMOS 
circuits contribute to their widespread adoption in microprocessors, memory 
devices, and application-specific integrated circuits.
Application of MOSFET
MOSFETs are versatile devices with a broad range of applications, including 
power electronics, signal amplification, and switching.

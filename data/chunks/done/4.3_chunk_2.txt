These devices can be classified 
into three categories:
Input Devices: Devices like keyboards, mice, and scanners that allow users to 
input data into the system.
Output Devices: Devices such as monitors, printers, and speakers that present 
processed data to the user.
Storage Devices: Includes hard drives, SSDs, and optical drives, which store 
data persistently.
Peripheral devices are connected to the CPU via interfaces and require drivers 
for communication.

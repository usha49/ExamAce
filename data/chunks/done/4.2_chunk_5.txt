The goal of the 
memory hierarchy is to provide the CPU with data at the fastest possible rate 
while minimizing the overall cost of the system. Properly designed memory 
hierarchies significantly enhance system performance by ensuring that frequently 
accessed data resides in faster memory levels.
Internal and External memory
Internal memory refers to storage located directly within the computing system 
and accessible by the CPU without requiring additional input/output operations.

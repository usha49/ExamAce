Depreciation is another critical factor in
engineering economics, representing the reduction in value of assets over time. Various
depreciation methods, such as straight-line depreciation, declining balance depreciation, and
sum-of-the-yearsâ€™ digits, are used to calculate asset depreciation in Nepal. The taxation system
in Nepal includes income tax, corporate tax, and value-added tax (VAT), all of which impact
project budgeting and financial planning.

L(G1)* is generated by G= =(V, ∑,  R, S)   where  
V= V1   S 
∑= ∑1  
 
R= RI U {S  e ,   S  SS2}. 
 
Theorem 2: The class of context-free languages is not closed under intersection or 
complementation.

This is not very surprising: Recall that our proof that regular languages are closed under 
intersection depended on closure under complementation; and that construction required that the 
automaton be deterministic.

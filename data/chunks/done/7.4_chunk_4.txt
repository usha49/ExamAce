After a transaction
completes successfully, the changes it has made to the database persist, even if there are system failures. Transaction
State: Active – the initial state; the transaction stays in this state while it is executing. Partially committed – after the
final statement has been executed. Failed- after the discovery that normal execution can no longer proceed.

The first 
component is the state of the machine (K), the second is the portion of the input yet to be read 
(∑*) , and the third is the contents of the pushdown store, read top-down (Г *).  
For example, if the configuration were (q, W, abc), the ' a '  would be on the top of the stack and 
the 'c' on the bottom. If (p, x, α) and (q, y, β) are configurations of M, we say that (p, x, α) yields 
in one step (q, y, β) . Thus a configuration of the machine is a triple (q, string,  stack).

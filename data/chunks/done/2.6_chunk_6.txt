Vectored interrupts 
have predefined memory addresses for their corresponding ISRs, allowing for faster execution. Non-
vectored interrupts require additional processing to determine the ISR address. Maskable interrupts can 
be enabled or disabled through software, while non-maskable interrupts (NMIs) have the highest 
priority and cannot be disabled. 
The 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) is used to manage multiple interrupts efficiently.

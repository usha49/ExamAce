RIP uses the hop count to determine the best path 
between the router/location. Each router contains the RIP table, and the table is updated every 30 
seconds. Each router broadcasts its entire RIP table to its neighbor. 
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is the routing algorithm that uses the link state routing algorithm. It is 
the shortest path algorithm to calculate the best path from the source to the destination.

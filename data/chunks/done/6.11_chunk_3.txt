 Turing Machines. These form a simple abstract model of a “real” computer, such as your 
PC at home. 
Central Question in Automata Theory: Do these models have the same power, or can one model 
solve more problems than the other? 
 
Computability theory 
In the 1930’s, G¨odel, Turing, and Church discovered that some of the fundamental 
mathematical problems cannot be solved by a “computer”. (This may sound strange, because 
computers were invented only in the 1940’s).

A 3-to-8 decoder takes a 3-bit
input and activates one of eight output lines, essential for address decoding in memory circuits.
An encoder, the inverse of a decoder, compresses multiple active inputs into a smaller number
of outputs. A 4-to-2 encoder converts four input lines into a 2-bit binary representation, useful in
data compression and priority encoding.
Binary arithmetic operations include addition and subtraction.

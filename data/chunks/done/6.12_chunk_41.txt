Proof : In each case we show how to construct an automaton M that accepts the appropriate 
language, given two automata Ml and M2 (only Ml in the cases of Kleene star and 
complementation). 
Union  
The set of regular languages is closed under the union operation, i.e., if L1 and L2 are regular 
languages over the same alphabet ∑, then L1 ∪ L2 is also a regular language. 
 
Proof.   
Since L1 is regular, there is,  an NFA M1 = (K1, ∑, δ1, q1, F1), such that L1 = L(M1).

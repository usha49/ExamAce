Various threats 
such as cyberattacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access can compromise network systems, making 
it necessary to implement strong security measures. 
The fundamental properties of secure communication include confidentiality, authentication, message 
integrity, authorization, non-repudiation, availability, provenance, and anonymity. Confidentiality 
ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive information by encrypting data during 
transmission.

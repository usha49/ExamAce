This sinusoidal nature of EMF is foundational to alternating current systems, as 
it allows for efficient transmission and transformation of electrical energy.
Equations and waveforms of alternating Voltage and current 
Alternating voltage and current vary periodically with time, described 
mathematically by sinusoidal functions.

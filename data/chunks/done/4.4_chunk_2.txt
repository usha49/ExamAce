These systems integrate 
hardware and software tightly, with the hardware providing processing capability 
and the software defining the specific functions.
Embedded systems are used in various applications, from consumer electronics 
(e.g., smartphones, washing machines) to industrial automation, automotive 
systems, and medical devices. Key characteristics include real-time operation, 
low power consumption, and compact design.

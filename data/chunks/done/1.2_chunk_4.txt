To apply Thevenin's theorem, the portion of the circuit of 
interest is first isolated by removing the load resistance. The open-circuit 
voltage, also known as the Thevenin voltage, is then determined across the 
terminals where the load was connected. The equivalent resistance is found by 
deactivating all independent sources and calculating the resistance seen from 
the terminals.

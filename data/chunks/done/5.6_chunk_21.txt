Layer Security (TLS) ensures secure communication over the internet by encrypting data exchanged 
between clients and servers. Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) uses TLS to protect web traffic, 
preventing eavesdropping and data tampering. Secure Shell (SSH) enables encrypted remote access to 
network devices, replacing insecure protocols such as Telnet. 
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) establish secure connections over public networks by encrypting data 
packets.

Hubs can operate as repeaters by 
relaying messages to all connected computers. A repeater cannot do the intelligent routing performed 
by bridges and routers. 
Hubs are very similar to repeaters. A Hub is essentially a multiport repeater. Any electrical signal that 
comes into one port, goes out all other ports. Hubs are fundamentally used in networks that use twisted 
pair cabling to connect devices. They act as pathways to direct electrical signals to travel along.

A digital signature is generated by 

encrypting a hash of the message with the sender’s private key. The recipient verifies the signature 
using the sender’s public key. 
Secure email communication is achieved using encryption protocols such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). 
PGP encrypts email messages and attachments, preventing unauthorized access.

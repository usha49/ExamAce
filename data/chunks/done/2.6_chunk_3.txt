The TRAP 
interrupt has the highest priority and is non-maskable, meaning it cannot be disabled. It is used for 
critical operations such as handling power failures. The RST 7.5, RST 6.5, and RST 5.5 interrupts have 
decreasing priority levels and can be enabled or disabled through software instructions. The INTR 
interrupt is the lowest priority interrupt and requires an external controller to determine the ISR 
address.

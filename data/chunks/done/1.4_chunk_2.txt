The 
diode exhibits distinct characteristics:
Forward Bias: When the p-side is connected to the positive terminal of a voltage 
source and the n-side to the negative terminal, the diode allows current flow. 
The voltage required to overcome the barrier potential is typically 0.7 V for 
silicon and 0.3 V for germanium.
Reverse Bias: When the polarity is reversed, the diode blocks current flow 
except for a negligible leakage current.

So, M  A and M B  
strings of a's can be empty string so A e  or  it may consist of a leading a followed by a string 
of a's  
A aA 
Similarly  
B e 
B bB.  
 
For Example : To generate a string aaab. 
S  aMb 
   aAb   
 
 (MA) 
   aaAb  
 
 (AaA ) 
    aaaAb 
 
 (AaA ) 
  aaab    
 
(Ae )

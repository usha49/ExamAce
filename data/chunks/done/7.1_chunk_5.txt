Analyzing these
complexities helps in selecting the most efficient algorithm for solving a problem.
Linear data structures store data sequentially. Examples include stacks and queues. A stack
follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning elements are added and removed from
the top. The main operations performed on a stack include inserting an element at the top,
removing the top element, retrieving the top element without removing it, and checking if the
stack is empty.

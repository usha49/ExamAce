(iii) Restrict the number of variables on the right hand side of productions to two. 
 
Example 
Let us consider the grammar G= (V, , R, S) where  
V= {S, A, B} 
 = {a, b},and the productions R  are : 
S  
bA / aB 
A 
bAA / aS / a 
B  
aBB / bS / b 
find an equivalent grammar in CNF 
First, the only productions already in proper form are A a and B b.

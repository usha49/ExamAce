Simulators mimic the systemâ€™s behavior, while emulators replicate 
hardware functionality.
Cross-Compilers: Compile code on a host system for execution on the embedded 
target.
Hardware Debuggers: Tools like JTAG or SWD interfaces enable real-time debugging 
of the hardware.
A well-designed development environment improves productivity and reduces errors 
during system development.
Application-Specific Instruction-Set Processors
ASIPs are tailored processors designed for a specific application domain, 
offering a balance between flexibility and performance.

or, P’  =   T( tx , ty )  .  P                                        
With T( tx , ty ) as translation matrix, inverse of this translation matrix is obtained by representing  tx, ty  with  -tx, -ty. 
Similarly, the rotation transformation equation about the coordinate origin are
   	
	
  	
 x’              cosθ    -sinθ     0        x
            		
  	
 y’      =      sinθ     cosθ     0    .

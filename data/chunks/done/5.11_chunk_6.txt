WAN (Wide Area Network) is the biggest 
network providing global connectivity. 
The physical arrangement of computers in a communication network is called topology. Star topology 
connects every system to a central controller called a hub, transmitting all data through it. Bus topology 
uses a single cable as a backbone, with all nodes attached using T connectors. In a ring topology, failure 
of one computer disrupts the entire network.

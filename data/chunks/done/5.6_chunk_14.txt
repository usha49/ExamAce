IDS can be 
classified into network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host-based intrusion detection 
systems (HIDS). NIDS analyze network traffic for suspicious patterns, while HIDS monitor activity on 
individual devices. Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) go a step further by automatically blocking 
detected threats. A Key Distribution Center (KDC) facilitates secure key exchange in symmetric 
encryption systems by distributing cryptographic keys to authorized users.

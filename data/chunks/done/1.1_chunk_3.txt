Understanding Ohm's Law is crucial for analyzing both 
simple circuits, like a single resistor connected to a voltage source, and 
complex systems involving networks of components. 
electric voltage and current
Voltage and current are two fundamental concepts in electrical circuits. 
Voltage, often referred to as potential difference, is the measure of the 
electric potential energy per unit charge between two points in a circuit.

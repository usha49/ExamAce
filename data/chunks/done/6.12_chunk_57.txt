This construction ensures that a string w will be accepted if and only if w reaches an accepting 
state in both input DFAs. 
Steps Intersection 
Make a state (A, B) as final if both 
(i) A is a final state in L1 and 
(ii) B is a final state in L2 
 
 
 
 
Set Difference 
Proof:  
Let A and B be DFAâ€™s whose languages are L and M, respectively. 
Construct C, the product automaton of A and B. 
Make the final states of C be the pairs where A-state is final but B-state is not.

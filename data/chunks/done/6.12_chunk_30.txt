View a NFA as a occupying at any moment not a single state but a set of states, namely all the 
states that can be reached from the initial state  by means of the input consumed thus far.  
 The set of states of M' will be K' =2K    , the power set of states of M 
 The set of final state of M' will consist of all those subset of K that contains at least one 
final state of M. i.e. F'={ Q K : Q  F  Ø }   
 The definition of transition function  of M' is slightly complicated .

Synchronization ensures that both machines 
are synchronized when data frames are sent on the link. Error control detects and attempts to recover 
actual data bits when errors occur in transition. Flow control ensures that stations on the same link, 
which may have different speeds or capacities, can exchange data at the same speed. Multi-access 
mechanisms such as CSMA/CD are used to equip systems with the capability of accessing a shared 
media.

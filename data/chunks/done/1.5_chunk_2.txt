The key components of an oscillator circuit 
include an amplifier, which provides the necessary gain, and a feedback network, 
which determines the frequency of oscillation. The Barkhausen Criterion is a 
fundamental condition for sustained oscillation, stating that the loop gain 
(product of amplifier gain and feedback gain) must be equal to one, and the 
phase shift around the loop must be zero or an integer multiple of 2Ï€.

At the top of the hierarchy are registers, 
which provide the fastest access but have limited capacity. Next is cache 
memory, followed by main memory (RAM) and secondary storage (hard drives, SSDs). 
The hierarchy continues with tertiary storage devices like optical discs and 
network storage. Each level in the hierarchy is characterized by increasing 
access time and storage capacity but decreasing cost per bit.

They perform 
several functions:
Device Identification: Recognizing specific devices connected to the system.
Data Buffering: Temporarily storing data to handle speed mismatches between the 
CPU and the device.
Error Detection and Correction: Ensuring data integrity during transfer.
The I/O interface provides the hardware and software mechanisms necessary for 
communication between the CPU and peripherals.
 Key types of interfaces include:
Programmed I/O: The CPU controls data transfer through explicit instructions.
Interrupt-Driven I/O: The device interrupts the CPU when it is ready for data 
transfer, reducing CPU idle time.
Direct Memory Access (DMA): A dedicated controller transfers data directly 
between memory and the device without CPU intervention.
Modes of transfer
Data transfer between the CPU and I/O devices can occur in several modes:
Synchronous Transfer: Data is transferred at fixed intervals, with 
synchronization between the device and CPU.
Asynchronous Transfer: Data is transferred without fixed timing, using 
handshaking signals for synchronization.
Interrupt-Driven Transfer: The device signals the CPU via an interrupt when it 
is ready, allowing the CPU to perform other tasks in the meantime.
DMA Transfer: A high-speed mode where a DMA controller handles the transfer, 
bypassing the CPU to improve efficiency.
Direct Memory access
DMA enables data transfer between peripherals and main memory without CPU 
intervention, freeing the CPU for other operations.

Examples include Omega and Butterfly 
networks.
Inter-processor Communication and synchronization
Inter-processor communication is essential in multiprocessors to coordinate 
tasks and share data. Communication can occur via:
Shared Memory: Processors communicate by reading and writing to a common memory 
space. Mechanisms like semaphores and mutexes are used to prevent conflicts.
Message Passing: Processors exchange messages through a communication network.

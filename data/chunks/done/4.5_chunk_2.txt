Examples of operating systems include Windows, Linux, macOS, and real-time 
operating systems (RTOS) like VxWorks.
The OS can be classified into different types based on functionality:
Batch Operating Systems: Execute batches of jobs without user interaction.
Time-Sharing Operating Systems: Allow multiple users to interact with the system 
simultaneously.
Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS): Ensure tasks are executed within specific 
timing constraints.
Distributed Operating Systems: Enable resource sharing across multiple systems 
connected via a network.
Task
A task is a basic unit of work in a computing environment, often representing a 
program or a process to be executed.

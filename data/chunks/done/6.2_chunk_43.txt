((s, e, e),(f, e))  //change the state non deterministically  (middle of the input 
string is guessed by machine M itself) 
4. (( f, a, a), (f, e))  // pop a 
5. ((f, b, b),(f, e))  // pop b  
 
Here, ((s, e, e), (f, e))   means change to state f without reading /consuming any symbol. Clearly 
whenever the M is in state S it can non- deterministically choose either to push the next input 
symbol on the stack or to switch to state f without consuming any input.

The physical layer also determines the networkâ€™s physical 
topology, including star, ring, bus, or mesh configurations, and handles the physical addressing of 
devices. 
Transmission media play a crucial role in the physical layer by providing the actual pathways for data 
transmission. These media are classified into guided (wired) and unguided (wireless) categories. Guided 
transmission media include twisted pair cables, coaxial cables, and fiber optic cables.

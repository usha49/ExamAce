The transport layer provides two types of service to the application layer: connection-
oriented service and connectionless service. 
Transport Protocols: UDP, TCP 
The two main Transport layer protocols are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram 
Protocol (UDP). TCP provides reliable communication between two hosts. Examples include World Wide 
Web (HTTP), E-mail (SMTP TCP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Secure Shell (SSH).

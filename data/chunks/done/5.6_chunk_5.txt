Packet sniffing is a technique used by attackers to capture network traffic and 
analyze data packets for sensitive information. This can be mitigated by using encrypted communication 
protocols such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS). IP spoofing involves 
attackers disguising their identity by forging the source IP address of packets, tricking network devices 
into accepting malicious requests.

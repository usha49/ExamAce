The three main types of multiplexing are 
frequency division multiplexing (FDM), time division multiplexing (TDM), and wavelength division 
multiplexing (WDM). Frequency division multiplexing divides the bandwidth of the transmission medium 
into multiple frequency bands, each carrying a separate signal. It is commonly used in radio and 
television broadcasting.

This allows large
applications to run even if the system has limited physical memory. Paging is a technique used
in virtual memory management, where memory is divided into fixed-sized blocks called pages
that are mapped to frames in physical memory. Demand paging loads pages into memory only
when they are needed, reducing memory usage and improving efficiency.

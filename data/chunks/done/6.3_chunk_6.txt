The tape has a left end marked by special symbol denoted by ∆, but it extends infinitely to the 
right. We will use distinct symbols ←, and → to denote the head movement to left or right. 
Formal definition 
A Turing Machine is a quintuple (K, ∑, δ, s, H), where: 
 K - a finite set of states 
 ∑ - an alphabet. ∑ contains the blank symbol □ and the left end symbol ∆, but does 
not contain ← and →.

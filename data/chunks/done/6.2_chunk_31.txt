So all CFG's  are not accepted by FA. here  we 
need to remember the strings before it goes to next part of the string and compare it with first 
half but FA can't do this because in FA donâ€™t have capability of remember anything.  PDA  is 
essentially a FA with control of both an input tape and a stack to store what it has read. A stack is 
a FIFO. PDA can accept all CFGs.

Two approaches using logs :Deferred database modification ,Immediate database
modification . The immediate-modification scheme allows updates of an uncommitted transaction to be made to the
buffer, or the disk itself, before the transaction commits .Update log record must be written before database item is
written We assume that the log record is output directly to stable storage . Output of updated blocks to stable storage can
take place at any time before or after transaction commit .

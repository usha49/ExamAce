L1 cache is the fastest and resides 
within the CPU, while L3 cache is larger but slightly slower. 
Secondary memory refers to storage devices such as Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), Solid State Drives (SSDs), 
and flash storage. These devices provide long-term data retention and are non-volatile. Secondary 
memory is slower than RAM and cache but offers much higher storage capacity. 
The memory hierarchy is structured to optimize data access speeds and processing efficiency.

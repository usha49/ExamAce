Nothing else is a parse tree. 
 
Example 
For example, if G is the context-free grammar that generates the language of balanced 
parentheses , then the string ()() can be derived from S by at least two distinct derivations, 
namely, 
         
S  S S  (S)S  ()S  () (S)  ()() 
and 
S SSS(S)  (S)(S)  (S()  () () 
 
However, these two derivations are in a sense "the same." The rules used are the same, and they 
are applied at the same places in the intermediate string.

Thus instead of representing a point as (x , y ,z) , we represent if as (x , y , z, H), where two these 
quadruples represent the same point it one is a non zero multiple of the other the 
quadruple (0,0,0,0) is not allowed. 
 
A standard representation of a point (x , y ,z ,H) with H  not zero is given by  
                  (x/H ,  y/H,   z/H,  1). 
 
Transforming the point to this form is called homogenizing.

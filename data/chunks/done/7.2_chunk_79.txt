This method separates original file into subfiles. These
subfiles contain every kth element of the original file. The value of k is called an
increment. Eg. If k=5, then subfile consists of x[0], x[5], x[10],â€¦ is first sorted.After
the first k subfiles are sorted (usually by simply insertion), a new smaller value of k is
chosen and the file is again partitioned into a new set of subfiles.

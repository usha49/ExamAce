For floating-point arithmetic, the IEEE 
754 standard is commonly used, defining rules for representation, addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division of floating-point numbers. Logical 
operations are essential for tasks like mask generation, error checking, and 
data encryption.
The Memory Hierarchy
The memory hierarchy is a structured arrangement of memory types designed to 
balance speed, cost, and capacity.

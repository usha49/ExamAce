Ambiguity in CFG: 
Grammars such as G, with strings that have two or more distinct parse trees, are called 
ambiguous. 
If a grammar generates the same string in several different ways, we say that the string is derived 
ambiguously in that grammar. If a grammar generates some string ambiguously we say that the 
grammar is ambiguous.

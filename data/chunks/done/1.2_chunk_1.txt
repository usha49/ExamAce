1.2 Network theorems:
Concept of superposition theorem
The concept of superposition theorem is foundational in the analysis of linear 
electrical circuits. This theorem is used to calculate the total response in a 
circuit containing multiple independent sources by considering the effect of 
each source separately. In this process, all other sources are replaced with 
their internal impedances.

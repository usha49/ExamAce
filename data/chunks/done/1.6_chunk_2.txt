These amplifiers are commonly used in 
low-power audio amplification where signal fidelity is critical.
Class B amplifiers improve efficiency by using two transistors, each conducting 
for half the cycle (180Â°). The push-pull configuration reduces power wastage but 
introduces crossover distortion at the zero-crossing point of the waveform.

AI integrates various
disciplines, including computer science, mathematics, psychology,
neuroscience, and linguistics, to create systems capable of
performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
AI Perspectives
AI can be viewed from multiple perspectives:
Strong AI: The belief that machines can possess consciousness and
genuine understanding.
Weak AI: The view that machines can simulate human cognition without
true consciousness.
Applied AI: Focuses on developing systems that perform specific tasks,
such as medical diagnosis or autonomous driving.
Cognitive AI: Aims to mimic human thought processes to understand
intelligence better.
History of AI,
1950s: The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined in 1956 during
the Dartmouth Conference.

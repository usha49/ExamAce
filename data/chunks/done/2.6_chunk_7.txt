It 
prioritizes interrupt requests and sends them to the processor based on predefined priority levels. The 
PIC enables nested interrupt processing, where higher-priority interrupts can interrupt lower-priority 
ones. 
Interrupts are essential in real-time computing, embedded systems, and multitasking operating systems, 
enabling efficient handling of multiple concurrent tasks.

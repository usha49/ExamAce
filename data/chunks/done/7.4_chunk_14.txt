Two-phase locking does not ensure freedom
from deadlocks . Cascading roll-back is possible under two-phase locking. To avoid this, follow a modified protocol
called strict two-phase locking. Here a transaction must hold all its exclusive locks till it commits/aborts. Rigorous
two-phase locking is even stricter: here all locks are held till commit/abort. In this protocol transactions can be serialized
in the order in which they commit.

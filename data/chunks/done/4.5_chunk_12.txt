Common synchronization techniques include:
Semaphores: Counting mechanisms to control access to a shared resource.
Mutexes: Mutual exclusion locks that allow only one task to access a resource at 
a time.
Monitors: High-level synchronization constructs combining mutexes and condition 
variables.
Barriers: Ensure all tasks reach a specific point before proceeding.
Device Drivers 
Device drivers are specialized software that act as intermediaries between the 
operating system and hardware devices.

It is calculated as the square root of the 
average of the squares of instantaneous values over one cycle and is widely used 
in practical applications to quantify power.
Three phase system
A three-phase system is a method of generating, transmitting, and distributing 
electrical power using three alternating voltages or currents that are phase-
shifted by 120 degrees from each other. This system is highly efficient and 
widely used in industrial and power applications.

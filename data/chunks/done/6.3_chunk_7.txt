 s  є  K - the initial state 
 H  K 
- the set of halting states 
 δ - the transition function.  This is a function from (K - H) x ∑ to K x (∑ È {←,→}) 
such that 
a. for all q є K - H, if δ(q , 
 ) = (p, b) then b = → 
If the head is at the left end of the tape, the only possible action is  to move one 
position to the right.  
b. for all q є K - H, and a є ∑, if δ(q , a) = (p, b) then b ≠ 
. 
It is not allowed to write on the tape the left end symbol.

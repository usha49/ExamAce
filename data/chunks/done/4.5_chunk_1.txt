Operating System Basics
An operating system (OS) is a system software that acts as an intermediary 
between hardware and user applications. It manages hardware resources, provides 
a user interface, and facilitates the execution of application programs. Key 
functions of an OS include process management, memory management, file system 
management, I/O device management, and ensuring system security and protection.

Segmentation is
another memory management technique where memory is divided into variable-sized segments,
each representing a logical unit such as functions, arrays, or modules.
Performance in memory management is affected by factors such as access time, page fault
rate, and memory allocation strategies. A page fault occurs when a requested page is not
present in memory and needs to be loaded from disk.

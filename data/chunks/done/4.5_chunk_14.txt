A driver abstracts the hardware's functionality and presents a 
standardized interface to the OS.
Key Functions of Device Drivers are:
Device Initialization: The driver sets up the hardware by configuring registers, 
enabling power, and preparing it for communication.
Data Transfer: The driver handles data exchange between the hardware and memory 
using methods like programmed I/O, interrupt-driven I/O, or DMA (Direct Memory 
Access).
Interrupt Handling: When a device generates an interrupt (e.g., indicating task 
completion), the driver processes it, ensuring the system responds 
appropriately.
Error Handling: Drivers detect and handle hardware faults or communication 
errors, logging errors for diagnostics.
Control Commands: Drivers allow software to send specific commands to the 
hardware, such as changing modes or settings.
Types of Device Drivers are:
Character Drivers: Manage character-oriented devices like keyboards and serial 
ports, processing data one character at a time.
Block Drivers: Handle devices like hard drives, organizing data into fixed-size 
blocks for storage and retrieval.
Network Drivers: Facilitate communication over networks by implementing 

protocols like TCP/IP.
Virtual Device Drivers: Simulate hardware functionality in software, often used 
in virtual machines.
Driver Development
Driver development requires understanding the hardware's architecture and 
operating system internals.

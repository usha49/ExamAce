Proof: Let A and B be DFA’s whose languages are L1 and L2, respectively. 
 Construct C, the product automaton of A and B. 
 Make the final states of C be the pairs consisting of final states of both A and B. 
Since L1 is regular, there is,  an DFA  M1 = (K1, ∑, δ1, q1, F1), such that L1 = L(M1). Similarly, 
there is an DFA M2 = (K2, ∑, δ2, q2, F2), such that L2 = L(M2).

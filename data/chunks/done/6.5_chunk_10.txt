Rotate in anti-clockwise direction by same angle
here, 
R   =     cosθ     sinθ           R’   =     cosθ    -sinθ       
            -sinθ     cosθ                          sinθ     cosθ    
For reflection against x-axis,
R f =     1    0
             0    1
       so for  θ = 45 we get
R(y = -x)  =        0     -1
 -1       0

Shearing
Distorts the shape of object in either ‘x’ or ‘y’ or both direction
In case of single directional shearing (e.g.

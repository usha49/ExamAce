Example 3:  
Design a DFA, the language recognized by the Automaton being L = {a n b: n ≥ 0} 
Solution 
Let required DFA M= (K,∑, δ, s, F)  
where 
K= {q0,  q1 , q2 } 
∑= { a ,b} 
s=q0 
F= {   q1 } and δ is the function tabulated below 
 
δ/∑

Example 4 
Given ∑ = {a, b}, construct a DFA that shall recognize the language  L = {bmabn :m,  n > 0}.

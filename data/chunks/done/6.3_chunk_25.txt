That means there exists a Turing machine T1 
that, given any string of the language, halts and accepts that string. 
Now let's also suppose that the complement of L, -L = {w: w √è L}, is recursively enumerable. 
That means there is some other Turing machine T2 that, given any string of -L, halts and accepts 
that string. 
Clearly, any string (over the appropriate alphabet ) belongs to either L or -L. Hence, any string 
will cause either T1 or T2 (or both) to halt.

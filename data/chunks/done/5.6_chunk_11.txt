Secure Sockets Layer 
(SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypt data transmitted over the internet, securing web 
browsing, online banking, and email services. Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) provides security at the 
network layer by encrypting IP packets, protecting data as it travels between networks.

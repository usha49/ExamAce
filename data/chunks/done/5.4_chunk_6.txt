If the receiver is not able to manage with the flow of 
data, then data flow should be controlled from the sender side, that part is done on the Transport layer. 
Data link layer is also doing flow control, but it controls the flow of data between adjacent nodes in the 
path from source to destination.

In computer networks, multiplexing is a technique by which multiple analog or digital signals are 
combined into one signal over a shared medium for transmission.

Time division multiplexing assigns different time slots to multiple signals, 
allowing them to share the same transmission channel in a sequential manner. It is used in digital 
telecommunication systems. Wavelength division multiplexing is used in fiber optic networks, where 
multiple data streams are transmitted simultaneously using different wavelengths of light. 
Switching techniques are used in networks to manage the transmission of data between devices.

non-determinism : zero or more than one possible value may exist for state transition 
For each p є K and each a є ∑{ e} , δ (s, a) =R  means  
"Upon reading an 'a ' the automaton M may transition from state s to any state in R." 
For e in particular, δ (s, e) =R means,  
"Without reading the symbol the automaton M may transition from s to any state in R"

Examples  
To see that a nondeterministic finite automaton can be a much more convenient device to design than a 
deterministic finite automaton, consider the language L = (ab U aba)*, which is accepted by the 
deterministic finite automaton illustrated in below 
 
L is accepted by the simple nondeterministic device shown in fig below

Example 2: Design a nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) that accept the set of all strings 
containing an occurrence of the pattern bb or of the pattern bab.

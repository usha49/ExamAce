VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) logically group devices within a network, improving security, 
reducing broadcast traffic, and enhancing management. VLANs can be configured statically or 
dynamically using VLAN Membership Policy Servers (VMPS). WLAN (Wireless LAN), based on IEEE 802.11 
standards, enables wireless networking through infrastructure or ad-hoc modes. Wireless networks 
offer mobility, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility in various environments.

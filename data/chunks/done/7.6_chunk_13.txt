Caching improves performance by storing frequently
accessed file data in memory, reducing disk I/O operations. Journaling file systems, such as
ext3, ext4, and NTFS, maintain a log of file system changes before committing them, preventing
data loss in case of system crashes.

System administration involves managing and maintaining computer systems, networks, and
servers to ensure smooth operation.

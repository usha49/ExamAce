They can be classified into:
Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP): All processors share the same memory and are 
equally capable of executing instructions.
Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP): Processors have specialized roles, with one 
serving as the master and the others as slaves.
Key characteristics include:
Parallelism: Multiprocessors achieve high performance by executing multiple 
instructions simultaneously.
Scalability: Adding more processors can increase the system's processing 
capability.
Shared Resources: Memory, I/O devices, and the bus are shared among processors, 
requiring efficient resource management.
Interconnection Structure
The interconnection structure determines how processors, memory, and I/O devices 
communicate in a multiprocessor system.

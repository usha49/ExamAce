Examples include the Colpitts 
Oscillator, which employs a capacitive divider in its feedback network, and the 
Hartley Oscillator, which uses an inductive divider. LC oscillators are widely 
used in high-frequency applications, such as radio transmitters and receivers, 
due to their ability to generate stable waveforms over a wide frequency range.

Firewalls operate at different layers of the OSI model, with packet filtering firewalls inspecting 
data packets at the network layer and application gateways analyzing traffic at the application layer. 
Stateful inspection firewalls track the state of active connections to make more intelligent filtering 
decisions. 
Securing network connections is essential for preventing data breaches and cyberattacks.

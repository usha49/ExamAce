This 
distortion makes Class B amplifiers unsuitable for high-quality audio 
applications without additional circuitry.
Class AB amplifiers bridge the gap between Classes A and B by slightly biasing 
both transistors to conduct for a little over 180Â°. This design minimizes 
crossover distortion while achieving better efficiency than Class A.

According to this theorem, maximum power 
is delivered to the load when the load resistance equals the internal resistance 
of the source or the Thevenin equivalent resistance. This principle is widely 
applied in electrical and electronic engineering, particularly in designing 
systems like audio amplifiers and communication circuits.

Read-only memory (ROM) contains 
permanent instructions such as firmware, while random-access memory (RAM) provides temporary 
storage for data being processed. Input and output devices allow the microprocessor to interact with 
external systems. Input devices such as keyboards and sensors send data to the processor, while output 
devices such as monitors and printers display the results of computation.

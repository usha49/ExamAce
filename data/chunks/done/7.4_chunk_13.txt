The Two-Phase Locking Protocol :This is a
protocol
which
ensures
conflict-serializable
schedules.
Phase
1:
Growing
Phase
:transaction
may
obtain
locks ,transaction may not release locks .Phase 2: Shrinking Phase :transaction may release locks ,transaction may not
obtain locks . The protocol assures serializability. It can be proved that the transactions can be serialized in the order of
their lock points (i.e. the point where a transaction acquired its final lock).

Solution :  
 
Let required PDA,   M= (K, ∑, Г ,∆ , S , F) where  
K = {q1 , q2, q3, q4, q5,  q6,  q7} 
∑= {a, b,c} 
Г= {a, b} 
F = {q4, q7} and 
 ∆  is given by following transition diagram  
 
Informally the PDA for this language works by first reading and pushing the a's. When 
the a's are done the machine has all of them on the stack so that it can match them with 
either the b's or the c's.

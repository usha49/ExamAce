Risk identification
involves recognizing potential issues such as budget overruns, resource shortages, technical
failures, and regulatory changes. Once identified, risks are assessed based on their likelihood
and impact on the project. Risk mitigation strategies are then developed to minimize negative
consequences. These strategies may include contingency planning, insurance, diversification,
and contractual protections.

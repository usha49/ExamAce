For a list that is nearly correct to begin with, selection sort is
slower than insertion sort.Divide and Conquer Sorting Algorithms:The idea of dividing a
problem into smaller but similar subproblems is called divide and conquer.Divide and Conquer
Sorting:Procedure :Sort(list) if (list has length greater than 1),Partition the list into two sublists
lowlist, highlist;Sort(lowlist);Sort(highlist);Combine (lowlist, highlist);End If;End Procedure
Quick Sort:It is the fastest known sorting algorithms used in practice.Divide the list into two
sublists such that all elements in the first list is less than some pivot key and all elements in the
second list is greater than the pivot key, and finally sort the sublists independently and combine
them.Algorithm:If size of list A is greater than 1:Pick any element v from A.

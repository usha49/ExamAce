However, the abrupt switching between the transistors at 
the zero-crossing introduces crossover distortion. To mitigate this issue, Class 
AB amplifiers, which maintain slight conduction overlap, are preferred in audio 
applications.
Class AB Output Stage
Class AB amplifiers operate with transistors biased slightly above cutoff, 
ensuring that both transistors conduct during the zero-crossing of the waveform.

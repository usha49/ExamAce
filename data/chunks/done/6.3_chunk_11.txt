We say that C1 immediately yields C2 ,  C1 â”œ M C2 
Initial configuration: initial state, contents of the tape, the head may be in any position 
Halting configuration: halting state, any contents of the tape, any position of the head 
Computation: defined as a sequence of configurations, each one immediately yielding the next, 
except for the last configuration 
 
Example 
The erasing machine: 
Reads a symbol a from the tape, replaces the symbol with a blank, and moves to the next symbol.

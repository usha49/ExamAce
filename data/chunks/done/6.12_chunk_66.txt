Only If Part  
(a) Regular Expression to NFA Construction 
Proof:  
Recall that the class of regular languages is the smallest class of languages containing the empty 
set Ã¸ and the singletons a, where a is a symbol, and closed under union concatenation, and 
Kleene star. It is evident (see Figure below) that the empty set and all singletons are indeed 
accepted by finite automata; and by Theorem  the finite automaton languages are closed under 
union, concatenation, and Kleene star.

Implementing strong encryption, access controls, intrusion detection systems, and 
security policies helps mitigate risks and protect sensitive data. Future advancements in network 
security technologies, such as quantum cryptography and artificial intelligence-driven threat detection, 
will enhance the ability to detect and prevent cyberattacks. 
In conclusion, network security is essential for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
data.

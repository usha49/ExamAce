A  B ={ x:  x є A  or  x є B} 
 
Intersection 
The “intersection” of sets A and B, written A ∩ B, is a set that contains exactly those elements 
that are in both A and B. 
A ∩ B = {x : x є A and x є B} 
 
Set Difference 
The “set difference” of set A and set B, written as A–B, is the set that contains 
everything that is in A but not in B. 
A - B = {x : x є A and x є B} 
 
Complement 
The “complement” of set A, written as A is the set containing everything that is not in A.

Solution: By analysis of language the machine must guess when it has reached the middle of the 
input string and change from state s to state f in a non deterministic fashion.  
 
Let required PDA,   M= (K, ∑, Г ,∆ , S , F) where  
K = {s , q, f} 
∑= {a, b} 
Г= {a, b} 
F = {f} and  
∆  is given by following five transitions 
1. ((s, a, e),(s, a) //push a 
2. ((s, b, e),(s, b) //push b 
3.

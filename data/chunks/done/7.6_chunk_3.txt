This mechanism helps
run multiple processes efficiently, especially when the system has limited physical memory.
However, excessive swapping can lead to thrashing, where the system spends more time
swapping processes in and out rather than executing them, reducing overall performance.
Managing free memory space is essential to avoid fragmentation and ensure efficient allocation.
Memory fragmentation occurs when free memory is scattered across small, non-contiguous
blocks, making it difficult to allocate larger memory segments.

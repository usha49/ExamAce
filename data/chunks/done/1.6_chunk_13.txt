Applications include motor drives, inverters, 
and power supplies.
Transformer-Coupled Push-Pull Stages
In transformer-coupled push-pull amplifiers, the output stage uses a transformer 
to combine the outputs of two transistors operating in push-pull mode. The 
transformer provides impedance matching between the amplifier and the load, 
improving power transfer efficiency. This configuration reduces even-order 
harmonics, enhancing the fidelity of the amplified signal.

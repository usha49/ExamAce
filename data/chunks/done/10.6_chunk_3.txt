The NEC categorizes engineers into different
levels based on their qualifications and experience, such as graduate engineers, professional
engineers, and senior engineers. This classification helps regulate the profession and ensures
that only qualified individuals are allowed to design and implement engineering projects.
The NEC also plays a crucial role in accrediting engineering institutions and programs.

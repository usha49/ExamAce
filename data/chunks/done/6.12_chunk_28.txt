NFA (K,∑, δ, s, F) is deterministic if and only if there are no 
transition of the form (q, e, p) in δ  and for each q ∈ K and a ∈ ∑ there is a  exactly one p ∈ K 
such that (q, a, p ) ∈ ∆ 
It is there fore evident that the class of languages accepted by DFA is a subset of the class of 
languages accepted by NFA. Rather surprisingly these classes are in fact equal. 
Despite the power and generality enjoyed by NFA, they are no more powerful than the NFA in 
terms of the language they accept.

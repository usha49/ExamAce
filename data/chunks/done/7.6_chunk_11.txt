Contiguous allocation suffers from external
fragmentation, linked allocation can suffer from scattered file storage, and indexed allocation
requires additional overhead for storing index blocks. The operating system must balance
speed, storage efficiency, and fragmentation when implementing file systems.
Mapping file blocks on the disk platter determines how file data is stored physically on disk
sectors.

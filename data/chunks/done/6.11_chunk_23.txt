Let A= { 1, 2, 3}  
then R= { (1, 1),  (2, 2) , (3, 3) , (1, 2), (2, 3) }  
 
A set S together with a partial ordering R is called a “Partially ordered set” or “Poset”. 
 
Partition 
A Partition P of S is a collection {Ai} of nonempty subsets of S with the properties: 
(i) Each a є  S belongs to some Ai, 
(ii) If Ai  ≠ Aj, then Ai  ∩ Aj = ø. 
 
 
Functions 
Suppose every element of S occurs exactly once as the first element of an ordered pair.

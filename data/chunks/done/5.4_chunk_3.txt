unreliable communication between two hosts. Examples include Domain Name System (DNS), 
Streaming media applications such as movies, Online multiplayer games, Voice over IP (VoIP), and Trivial

Port and Socket 
A port is one of the circuit connection points on a front-end processor or local intelligent controller. The 
TCP and UDP protocols use ports to map incoming data to a particular process running on a computer.

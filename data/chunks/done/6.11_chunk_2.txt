Nowadays, the Theory of Computation can be divided into the 
following three areas:  
 Automata Theory 
 Computability Theory 
 Complexity Theory, 
 
Automata theory 
Automata Theory deals with definitions and properties of different types of “computation 
models”. Examples of such models are: 
 Finite Automata. These are used in text processing, compilers, and hardware design. 
  Context-Free Grammars. These are used to define programming languages and in 
Artificial Intelligence.

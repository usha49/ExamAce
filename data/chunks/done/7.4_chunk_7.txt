Thus serial execution of a set of transactions preserves database consistency.
A (possibly concurrent) schedule is serializable if it is equivalent to a serial schedule.
Different forms of schedule
equivalence give rise to the notions of: conflict serializability ,view serializability.Conflict Serializability : If a
schedule S can be transformed into a schedule S´ by a series of swaps of non-conflicting instructions, we say that S and S´
are conflict equivalent.

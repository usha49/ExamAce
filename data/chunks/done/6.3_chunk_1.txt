Chapter 4 : Turing Machine 
 
INCOMPLETE CHA……  NEEDS TO BE Update 
Neither finite automata nor pushdown automata can be regarded as truly general models for 
computers, since they are not capable of recognizing even such simple languages as {anbncn : n ≥ 
0}. 
Turing machines are abstract devices by means of which we can formalize any computation.  
They stand at the heart of the theory of computation. 
Turing machines are finite state automata.

System errors: the database system must terminate an active transaction due to an error
condition (e.g., deadlock). System crash: a power failure or other hardware or software failure causes the system to
crash. Fail-stop assumption: non-volatile storage contents are assumed to not be corrupted by system crash . Database
systems have numerous integrity checks to prevent corruption of disk data . Disk failure: a head crash or similar disk
failure destroys all or part of disk storage.

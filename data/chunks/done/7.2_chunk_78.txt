However it will take time O(logn) to restore the heap
property for remaining keys.For insertion we shift the new item from down to up which
also takes O(logn).Hence, implementation of a priority queue as a heap proves
advantageous for large n.It efficiently represents in contiguous storage and is guaranteed
to require only logarithmic time for both insertions and deletions.Shell Sort:Significant
improvement on simple insertion sort can be achieved by using shell sort (or
diminishing increment sort).

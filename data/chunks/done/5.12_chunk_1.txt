Chapter 2: Physical Layer 
The physical layer is the lowest layer in the OSI model and is responsible for transmitting raw data bits 
from one node to another over a communication medium. This layer is not concerned with the meaning 
of the data but focuses on ensuring that the data is accurately transmitted as electrical, optical, or radio 
signals over the physical medium.

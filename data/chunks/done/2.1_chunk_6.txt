The XOR gate outputs high when the inputs differ, while the XNOR gate outputs
high when inputs are the same.
Boolean algebra provides mathematical rules to simplify logic expressions, making circuits
more efficient. The commutative law states that the order of operands does not affect the
result, as seen in A + B = B + A and A·B = B·A. The associative law allows grouping of terms
without changing results, such as (A + B) + C = A + (B + C).

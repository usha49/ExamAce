The average value of a 
sine wave over one complete cycle is zero, but over a half-cycle, it represents 
the mean of the absolute values of the waveform. The RMS value is particularly 
important in AC systems as it provides a measure of the effective or equivalent 
DC value of an alternating quantity.

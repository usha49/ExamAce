Wireshark is the world’s foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer. It lets you see what’s 
happening on your network at a microscopic level and is the de facto (and often de jure) standard 
across many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government agencies, and educational 
institutions. 
Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulation program that allows students to experiment with 
network behavior and ask “what if” questions.

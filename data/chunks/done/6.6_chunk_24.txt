after  applying the above transformation to the object reflect the object thru the  z = 0 coordinate 
plane. 
i.e. 
                        1     0      0     0               
          RFz =    0      1     0     0              
                        0      0    -1     0               
                        0      0     0     1          
 
iv. 
Perform the inverse transformation to those given above to achieve the desired result.

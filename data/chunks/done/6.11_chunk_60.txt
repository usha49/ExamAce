The right side 
also denotes any string of 0's and 1's, since 0 and 1 are each in L(0*1*). 
• NOTE: extensions of the test beyond regular expressions may fail. 
 Consider the “law” L ∩M ∩N = L∩M. 
 This is clearly false 
– Let L=M={a} and N= Ø. {a} ≠Ø. 
– But if L={a} and M = {b} and N={c} then 
– L∩M does equal L∩M ∩N which is empty. 
– The test would say this law is true, but it is not because we are applying the test beyond regular 
expressions.

Although widely used 
in early audio amplifiers, transformer coupling has been largely replaced by 
modern designs due to its bulk and potential bandwidth limitations.
Tuned Amplifiers
Tuned amplifiers are specialized circuits designed to amplify signals at a 
specific frequency or within a narrow frequency band. These amplifiers 
incorporate resonant LC circuits in their design to achieve high selectivity and 
gain at the desired frequency.

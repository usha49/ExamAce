They are widely used 

in laboratories for testing and troubleshooting circuits.
Signal Generators: Specifically designed to produce high-frequency signals, 
often with modulated waveforms, for use in communication and radar systems.
Pulse Generators: Used to produce square or rectangular pulses for testing 
digital circuits and timing applications.
The design of waveform generators typically involves the use of oscillators 
combined with shaping circuits to produce the desired waveform.

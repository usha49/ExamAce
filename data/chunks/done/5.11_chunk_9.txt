In peer-to-peer networks, computers share data and resources without a dedicated server. 
Active networks or software-defined networking (SDN) allows software to dynamically control and 
manage network functions, providing flexibility and programmability. 
Protocols and Standards 
Protocols define how data is communicated across networks, specifying message formats, timing, and 
error-handling rules. Network protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS.

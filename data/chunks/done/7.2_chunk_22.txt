The Transitive closure helps to determine which pair or
vertices in a digraph are connected by a path. It takes O(n4) time complexity.To find at least one
path between two nodes, we can check adj1, adj2, adj3, …,adjmaxnodes1. If any of the adjacency
matrix give true value for node ‘i’ and ‘j’, then there exist at least a path between nodes ‘i’ and
‘j’. Let ‘m’ is the highest order of length and ‘n’ is the no. of total nodes.

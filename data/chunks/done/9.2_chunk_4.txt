destined to reach top of Everest but due to thick fog (poor visibility) and forgetting

• Hill Climbing Search initiates a loop that continuously moves in the direction of
increasing value
• Terminates when it reaches a “Peak”
• Doesn’t maintain a search tree so the current node data structure needs only record the
state and its objective function value.
• Hill climbing does not look ahead beyond the immediate neighbors of the current state.

• One move is selected and all other nodes are rejected and are never considered.
• Halts if there is no successor.
• Problem: depending on initial state, can get stuck in local maxima

This simple policy has three well-known
drawbacks:

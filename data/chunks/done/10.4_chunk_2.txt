A well-structured project management system integrates multiple aspects,
including information systems, risk management, financing, tendering, and contract
management.
A project information system is a critical component of project management, allowing the
collection, organization, and analysis of project-related data. It enables project managers to
track progress, allocate resources efficiently, identify risks, and maintain communication among
stakeholders.

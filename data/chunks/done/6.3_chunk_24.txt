All recursive languages are recursively enumerable - we can always make the rejecting state 'n' a 
nonhalting state from which the machine never halts.

However, there are recursively enumerable languages that are not recursive, as shown in the next 
section. 
Theorem: If a language and its complement are both recursively enumerable, then both are 
recursive. 
Proof: 
Suppose a language L is recursively enumerable.

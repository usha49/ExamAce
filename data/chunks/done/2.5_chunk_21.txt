In cycle stealing mode, the 
DMA controller temporarily pauses the CPU to transfer data. In transparent mode, data transfers occur 
when the processor is idle, ensuring minimal performance impact. 
DMA technology is widely used in hard drives, sound cards, network adapters, and embedded systems to 
optimize data handling and enhance overall system performance.

Sustainable engineering practices aim to minimize negative environmental impacts
by promoting energy efficiency, waste reduction, and the use of renewable resources. Social
responsibility in engineering includes ensuring accessibility, affordability, and safety in
infrastructure projects, particularly for marginalized communities.
Professional ethics in engineering is guided by principles such as integrity, accountability,
honesty, fairness, and respect for human rights.

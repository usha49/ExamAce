Alternating current fundamentals:
Principle of generation of alternating voltages and currents
The generation of alternating voltage and current is based on the principle of 
electromagnetic induction, discovered by Michael Faraday. When a conductor moves 
through a magnetic field, or when the magnetic field surrounding a stationary 
conductor varies, an electromotive force (EMF) is induced in the conductor. In 
practical systems, this is achieved using rotating machines like alternators.

The basic idea is that 
a move of M' on reading an input symbol a , possibly followed by any number of e-
moves of M.  
For every Q  K and a ∈ ∑  
δ '(Q, a)=  E( ⋃
ߜ(ݍ, ܽ)
௤∈Q
) 
To formalize this idea we need a special definition 
For any state q є K , let E(q) be the set of all states of M that are reachable from state q  
without reading any input (e-moves) i.e.

We denote the reflexive, transitive closure of 
is read, (q, 
w) yields (q', w') (after some number, possibly zero, of steps).  
 
A string w є ∑* is said to be accepted by M if and only if there is a state q є F such that  
(s, w) 
 (q, e). Finally, the language accepted by M, L(M), is the set of all strings accepted by M. 
 
Example 1 
Design a DFA that accepts the language L which has set of strings in {a, b } *  that have even number of 
b's .

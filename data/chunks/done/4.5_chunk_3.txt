In embedded or real-time systems, tasks are 
defined to perform specific operations, such as reading sensor data or 
controlling actuators. Tasks can be classified into:
Periodic Tasks: Execute at regular intervals.
Aperiodic Tasks: Execute sporadically, triggered by events.
Critical Tasks: Must meet strict timing deadlines to ensure system reliability.
Process
A process is an executing instance of a program, consisting of the program code, 
data, and execution context.

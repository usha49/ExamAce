2D Transformations
Translation
Repositioning an object along a straight line path from one coordinate location to another
Add translational distance tx ,ty to original coordinate position (x,y) to move the point to a new position (x’,y’) 
                        x’ = x + tx             y’ = y + ty
where the pair (tx , ty) is called the translation vector.
We can write equation as a single matrix equation by using column vectors to represent coordinate points and 
translation vectors.

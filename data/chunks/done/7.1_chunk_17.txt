The depth of
a node is the number of edges from the root node to that specific node.
An AVL tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between
the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one. If the balance factor of any node exceeds
this limit, rotations are performed to restore balance. AVL trees are used in applications
requiring efficient searching and sorting, such as database indexing and memory management.

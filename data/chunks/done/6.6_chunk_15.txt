substituting permutations in (i) for a y axis rotation we get, 
    z’ =   zcosθ  -  xsinθ                 x’ =   zsinθ  +  xcosθ                      y’ =  y  
3D y-axis rotation equations are expressed in homogenous coordinate form as 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      x’          cosθ       0     sinθ        0              x

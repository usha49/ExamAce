For instance, voltage sources are replaced with short 
circuits, while current sources are replaced with open circuits. After 
determining the contributions of each source individually, the total response is 
obtained by summing these contributions algebraically. Superposition is 
particularly beneficial in simplifying the analysis of circuits with multiple 
power sources, making it easier to determine voltage, current, or power at any 
point in the circuit.

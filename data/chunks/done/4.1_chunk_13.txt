Each mode 
provides different ways to access data, balancing flexibility and efficiency. 
For example, immediate addressing specifies the operand within the instruction, 
while indirect addressing refers to memory locations through pointers. 
Understanding addressing modes is essential for optimizing instruction execution 
and memory access in a CPU.
 Data transfer and manipulation
Data transfer involves moving data between memory, registers, and I/O devices.

A standard parallel communication system consists of an 8-bit or 16-bit data bus, allowing multiple bits 
to be transmitted in a single clock cycle. This improves data throughput compared to serial 
communication, where data is transmitted one bit at a time. However, parallel interfaces suffer from 
signal integrity issues, crosstalk, and increased hardware complexity due to the need for multiple 
communication lines.

Software interrupts are triggered by program instructions and are used for system calls and debugging. 
The 8085 microprocessor provides eight software interrupts, known as RST instructions (RST 0 to RST 7), 
which allow the execution of predefined routines stored in memory. 
When an interrupt occurs, the microprocessor follows a specific sequence to handle it. First, the 
processor completes the execution of the current instruction before acknowledging the interrupt.

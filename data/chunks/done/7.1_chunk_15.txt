Deletion removes a node while restructuring the tree to maintain its properties.
Traversal in binary trees is done using different methods. Pre-order traversal visits the root node
first, then recursively visits the left subtree followed by the right subtree. Post-order traversal
visits the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and finally the root node. In-order traversal
visits the left subtree first, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.

Common structures include:
Bus-Based Interconnection: All components are connected via a shared bus. While 
simple and cost-effective, it suffers from bandwidth limitations as the number 
of processors increases.
Crossbar Switch: Provides a direct connection between any pair of components, 
offering high performance at the cost of increased complexity.
Multistage Interconnection Networks: Use multiple switching stages to connect 
components, balancing cost and performance.

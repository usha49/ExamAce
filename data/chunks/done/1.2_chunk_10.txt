The current in these circuits lags 
the voltage due to the inductive reactance, which increases with frequency. In 
R-C circuits, comprising resistors and capacitors, the current leads the voltage 
due to capacitive reactance, which decreases with frequency. R-L-C circuits 
combine resistors, inductors, and capacitors, and their behavior is determined 

by the resonance condition.

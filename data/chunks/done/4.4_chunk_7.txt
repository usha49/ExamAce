Techniques include:
Pipelining: Splitting the task into stages to increase throughput.
Parallelism: Adding multiple functional units to perform operations 
simultaneously.
Hardware Specialization: Using dedicated hardware components for frequently used 
operations.
Low-Power Design: Minimizing energy consumption through techniques like clock 
gating and dynamic voltage scaling.

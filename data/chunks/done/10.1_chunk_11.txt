This technique helps engineers understand the internal
structure and hidden components of complex assemblies. Sectional drawings can be classified
into different types, including full sections, which cut through the entire object; half sections,
which show only half of the internal view while keeping the other half intact; and offset sections,
which follow a non-linear cutting plane to reveal important internal details.

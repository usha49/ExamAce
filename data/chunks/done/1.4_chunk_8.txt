It consists of 
four terminals: gate, source, drain, and body. The MOSFET operates by 
controlling the flow of current between the drain and source terminals through 
an electric field induced by the voltage applied to the gate terminal. The 
device operates in three regions: cutoff, linear, and saturation. In the cutoff 
region, the MOSFET is off, and no current flows. In the linear region, it acts 
as a variable resistor. In the saturation region, it operates as a current 
source.

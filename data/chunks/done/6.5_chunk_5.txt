P
Values greater than 1 for s x s y produce enlargement
Values greater than 1 for s x s y reduce size of object
s x  =  s x  = 1 leaves  the size of the object unchanged
When s x, s y are assigned the same value s x  =  s x  = 3  or 4 etc then a Uniform Scaling is produced.
Rotation
Repositioning an object along a circular path in x,y plane
Specify rotation angle ‘θ’ and position (x r,y r) of rotation point about which the object is to be rotated
+ value for ‘θ’ define counter-clockwise rotation about a point
-  value for ‘θ’ define clockwise rotation about a point
If (x,y) is the original point ‘r’ the constant distance from origin, ‘Φ’ the original angular displacement from x-axis.
Now the point (x,y) is rotated through angle ‘θ’ in a counter clock wise direction
Express the transformed coordinates in terms of ‘Φ’ and ‘θ’ as
x’ = r cos(Φ + θ) =  r cosΦ.

A situation in which two different keys k1 and k2 hash to the same index of the table i.e.
h(k1) = h(k2), it is called collision or hash clash. We have, in general following
methods.Folding method,Mid square method,Division method.Folding method Eg. Let the
keys be of four digits, chopping the key into two parts and adding yields Hash(5421) = 54 + 21
= 75 So 75 is the index at which w e should store or retrieve record with key 5421. Mid square
method: The key is squared.

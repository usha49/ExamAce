Serial interfaces are classified based on transmission techniques, including synchronous and 
asynchronous transmission. In synchronous transmission, data is sent at a fixed rate, synchronized with 
a common clock signal. This method is used in high-speed communication systems such as Ethernet and 
fiber optic networks. In asynchronous transmission, data is sent without a common clock, and each data 
byte is framed with start and stop bits to indicate the beginning and end of transmission.

10.2 Engineering Economics
Engineering economics is a specialized branch of economics that applies economic principles
to engineering decision-making. It helps engineers evaluate the financial feasibility of projects,
optimize resource allocation, and assess the long-term economic impact of technical solutions.
One of the fundamental aspects of engineering economics is understanding project cash flow,
which involves analyzing the inflow and outflow of money over a project's duration.

This is a bit tricky because the machine doesn't know in advance 
whether to match the a's with the b's or the c's. Non-determinism comes in handy here. 
Using its non-determinism, the PDA can guess whether to match the a's with the b's or 
with the c's, as shown in the following figure. Think of the machine as having two 
branches of its non-determinism, one for each possible guess. If either of them match, 
that branch accepts and the entire machine accepts.

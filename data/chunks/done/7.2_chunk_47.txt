When the linear method is used to resolve collisions, this
clustering problem is compounded, because keys that collide are loaded relatively close to the
initial collision point.Chaining: It is another technique to deal with collision. In this method, for
each location in the table, we keep a linked list of records that hash to the same index. The hash
table contains pointers to linked list nodes; we can view these as the head pointers.

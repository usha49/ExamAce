The master-slave
flip-flop consists of two interconnected flip-flops, where the master captures the input on the
clockâ€™s rising edge and transfers it to the slave on the falling edge, preventing glitches and race
conditions.
Registers consist of multiple flip-flops used to store multi-bit data. Shift registers, a type of
register, shift data left or right with each clock pulse, used in serial-to-parallel and parallel-to-
serial conversions.

Computer Science as the Foundation of AI
Computer science provides the programming tools, data structures,
algorithms, and computational power needed to implement AI systems.
Algorithms and Data Structures
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving computational
problems, while data structures organize data efficiently.
Key Concepts:
Search algorithms (e.g., depth-first search, breadth-first search).
Sorting algorithms.
Trees, graphs, and hash tables.
AI Applications:
Pathfinding algorithms in robotics.
Decision tree algorithms in machine learning.
Graph-based algorithms in social networks.
Programming Languages
Languages such as Python, C++, Java, and specific libraries like
TensorFlow and PyTorch are used to build AI applications.
Computational Complexity
Complexity theory helps understand the efficiency of algorithms.
Big O Notation describes the worst-case performance.
P vs NP Problem questions the solvability of certain problems in
polynomial time.

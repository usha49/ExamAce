Chapter 5: Interrupt Operations 
An interrupt is a signal sent by a peripheral device or an internal component to the processor, 
requesting immediate attention. Interrupts enable the microprocessor to handle real-time tasks 
efficiently by allowing it to pause its current execution and service the interrupting device before 
resuming normal operations.

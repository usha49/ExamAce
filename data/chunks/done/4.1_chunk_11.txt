The ALU 
works closely with the control unit and registers to execute instructions. 
Modern ALUs are designed for high-speed operations and may include floating-
point units (FPUs) for handling complex mathematical computations. The design of 
the ALU directly impacts the CPU's computational capabilities.
Instruction formats
Instruction formats define how machine instructions are encoded. They typically 
include fields for the opcode, source and destination operands, and addressing 
modes.

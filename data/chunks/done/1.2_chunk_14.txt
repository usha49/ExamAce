Reactive power, measured in volt-amperes 
reactive (VAR), represents the power that oscillates between the source and 
reactive components, such as inductors and capacitors, without being dissipated. 
The combination of these powers forms the apparent power, which is represented 
as a vector sum in the power triangle. Understanding the interplay between 
active and reactive power is crucial in power system design and operation, as it 
affects the efficiency and stability of electrical systems.

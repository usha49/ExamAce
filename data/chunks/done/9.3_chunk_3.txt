Approaches to Knowledge Representation
1. Logical Representation
Uses formal logic (e.g., Propositional Logic, Predicate Logic) to represent knowledge.
Example: "If it rains, the ground is wet" is represented as R→WR→W.
Advantages: Precise and unambiguous.
Disadvantages: Limited expressiveness for uncertain or incomplete knowledge.

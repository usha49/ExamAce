Key administration tasks include user account
management, where administrators create, modify, and delete user accounts; permissions and
access control, ensuring secure access to system resources; and process management, which
involves monitoring and controlling running applications.
User account management is essential for maintaining system security and organization. Each
user is assigned a unique username and password, and different user roles determine access
privileges.

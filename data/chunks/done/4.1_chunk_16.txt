Modern processors often combine elements of both 
paradigms to achieve optimal performance.
Pipelining parallel processing
Pipelining is a technique where multiple instruction stages (fetch, decode, 
execute) are overlapped to improve throughput. Each stage processes a different 
instruction, akin to an assembly line. Parallel processing involves executing 
multiple instructions simultaneously using multiple cores or threads.

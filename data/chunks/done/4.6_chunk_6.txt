Pipelining is widely used in CPUs, signal processors, and communication 
systems.
Key steps in implementing pipelining in VHDL:
Partitioning the Design: Divide the process into distinct stages with 
intermediate registers.
Synchronizing Stages: Use a clock signal to synchronize data flow between 
stages.
Balancing Latency: Ensure each stage has approximately equal delay to optimize 
throughput.
Example: Pipelined Adder in VHDL:
entity Pipelined_Adder is
  Port ( A, B : in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0);
         CLK  : in STD_LOGIC;
         SUM  : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0));
end Pipelined_Adder;
architecture Behavioral of Pipelined_Adder is
  signal stage1, stage2: STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0);
begin
  process(CLK)
  begin
    if rising_edge(CLK) then

      stage1 <= A + B;         -- First stage
      stage2 <= stage1;        -- Second stage
    end if;
  end process;
  SUM <= stage2;               -- Final output
end Behavioral;
Pipelining improves the design's overall throughput but introduces latency, as 
data must pass through all stages before producing the final output.

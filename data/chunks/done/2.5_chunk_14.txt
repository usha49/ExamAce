Mode 1 introduces handshake signals 
to facilitate synchronized data transfer, while Mode 2 allows bidirectional data flow between peripherals 
and the microprocessor. 
PPIs are widely used in applications such as keyboard interfacing, digital displays, and industrial 
automation systems. They simplify data transfer between the processor and peripherals, reducing the 
complexity of direct interfacing.

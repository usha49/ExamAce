Authentication verifies the identity of users and devices before granting access to network 
resources. Message integrity ensures that data is not altered during transmission by using cryptographic 
techniques such as checksums and hash functions. Authorization controls user permissions, allowing 
only specific actions based on predefined rules. Non-repudiation prevents users from denying their 
actions by digitally signing messages.

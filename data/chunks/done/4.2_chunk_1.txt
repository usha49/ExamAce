4.2 Computer arithmetic and memory system:
Arithmetic and Logical operation
Arithmetic and logical operations are the fundamental building blocks of 
computational processes in a CPU. Arithmetic operations include addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division, which are performed using specialized 
hardware units like adders and multipliers. These operations can be extended to 
support floating-point calculations, enabling high-precision mathematical 
computations.

Algorithm has been developed for
performing in-place merge in O(n) time, but this would increase the no of
assignments If recursive version is used, additional space is required for the implicit
stack, which is O(logn). Hence, Space complexity for Merge Sort is O(n).Notes on
Merge sort:Even though the worst-case running-time of Merge Sort is O(nlogn), it
is not an algorithm of choice for sorting contiguous lists.

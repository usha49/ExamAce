So, if T is
the minimum spanning tree of graph G and T’ is any other spanning tree of G then, W(T) ≤
W(T’).There are several algorithms available to determine the minimal spanning tree of a given
weighted graph.Kruskal’s Algorithm:To determine minimum spanning tree consider a graph G
with n vertices.Step 1: List all the edges of the graph G with increasing weights Step 2: Proceed
sequentially to select one edge at a time joining n vertices of G such that no cycle is formed

until n-1 edges are selected.Step 3: Draw the n-1 edges that were selected forming a minimal
spanning tree T of G.Round Robin Algorithm:This method provides better performance when
the number of edges is low.

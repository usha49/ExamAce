1.6 Amplifiers:
Classification of Output Stages
Amplifiers are classified into various output stages based on their operating 
conditions, efficiency, and distortion characteristics:
Class A amplifiers are known for their linearity and low signal distortion 
because the active device conducts for the entire 360Â° of the input cycle. 
However, their inefficiency arises from continuous power dissipation in the 
output device, even during idle operation.

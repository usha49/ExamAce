Advancements in microprocessor technology have led to the development of multi-core processors, 
cache memory, and parallel processing techniques. Multi-core processors contain multiple processing 

units on a single chip, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks. Cache memory reduces access times 
by storing frequently used data close to the processor. Parallel processing techniques, such as pipelining 
and vector processing, further enhance computational efficiency.

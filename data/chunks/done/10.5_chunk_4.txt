Engineers must adhere to ethical codes
established by professional organizations such as the Nepal Engineers Association (NEA) and
international bodies like the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the
American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). Ethical dilemmas in engineering may arise in areas
such as conflicts of interest, intellectual property rights, and safety standards.

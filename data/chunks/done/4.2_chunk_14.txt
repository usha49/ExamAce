Non-volatile memories like ROM and flash memory 
retain data without power but often have slower write speeds. Storage permanence 
is essential for applications requiring long-term data retention, such as 
firmware storage or archival systems.
Composing Memory
Composing memory involves integrating different types of memory to achieve a 
balance of speed, capacity, and cost. This includes designing memory hierarchies 
and optimizing the interaction between volatile and non-volatile storage.

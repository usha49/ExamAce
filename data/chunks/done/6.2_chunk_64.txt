And not all context-free languages are accepted by deterministic 
pushdown automata (e.g WWR   is context free language but not accepted by Deterministic PDA 
but can be accepted by non deterministic PDA) 
 
Theorem: The intersection of a context-free language with a regular language is a context-free 
language.

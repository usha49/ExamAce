They provide high bandwidth, long-distance transmission, and immunity to 
electromagnetic interference, making them ideal for high-speed networks and telecommunications. 
Unguided transmission media, also known as wireless media, transmit data through electromagnetic 
waves without requiring a physical connection. These media include radio waves, microwaves, and 
satellite communication.

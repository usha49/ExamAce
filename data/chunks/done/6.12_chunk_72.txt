Proof 
– Construct GNFA, Generalized NFA 
– State Elimination 
 Eliminates states of the automaton and replaces the edges with regular 
expressions that include the behavior of the eliminated states. 
 Eventually we get down to the situation with just a start and final node, and this is 
easy to express as a RE 
 
Let M = (K,,∆, s, F) be a finite automaton (not necessarily deterministic). We shall construct a 
regular expression R such that L(R) = L(M).

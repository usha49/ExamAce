In an operating system (OS), a process
scheduler performs the important activity of scheduling a process between the ready
queues and waiting queue and allocating them to the CPU. The OS assigns priority to
each process and maintains these queues. The scheduler selects the process from the
queue and loads it into memory for execution.

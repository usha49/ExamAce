Collections of processors arranged in a loosely coupled
configuration and interacting with each other over a communication channel have been
the
most
common
multiprocessor
architecture.
Advantage:
Increase
throughput ,Economy of scale ,Increased
reliability .Disadvantage: If one processor
fails then it will affect in the speed , Multiprocessor systems are expensive ,Complex OS
is required, Large main memory required.

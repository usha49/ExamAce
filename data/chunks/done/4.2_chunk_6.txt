Examples include registers, cache, and RAM. These memories are critical for 
high-speed data processing and temporary storage during program execution. 
External memory, on the other hand, includes storage devices such as hard 
drives, SSDs, and external USB drives. These are used for long-term data storage 
and backup. External memory is slower than internal memory but offers 
significantly larger storage capacities.

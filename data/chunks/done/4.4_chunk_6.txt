The design involves:
Defining Specifications: Identifying the specific task and performance 
requirements.
Creating Data Path: Designing the computational logic, including ALUs, 
registers, and memory components, tailored to the task.
Implementing Control Logic: Developing finite state machines (FSMs) or 
microprograms to control data flow and operation sequencing.
Custom processors are preferred for applications where general-purpose 
processors cannot meet the performance, power, or cost constraints, such as in 
signal processing or cryptographic systems.
Optimizing Custom Single-Purpose Processors
Optimization focuses on improving speed, power efficiency, and area (size).

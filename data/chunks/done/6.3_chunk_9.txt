b = →) 
 if b є ∑ then M writes b on the tape, however it is not allowed to write 
 
 if b = → then M moves its head to the right, preparing to read the next symbol from the tape 
 if b = ← then M moves its head one position to the left,  preparing to read the next symbol 
from the tape 
δ is not defined for the halting states. If M enters a halting state, then the operation stops. 
 
Configurations and computations 
Formally, the operation of M is described in terms of its configurations.

Different types of ROM include PROM (Programmable ROM), EPROM (Erasable Programmable 
ROM), and EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM), each with varying capabilities for data 
modification. 
Cache memory is a high-speed memory placed between the processor and RAM. It stores frequently 
accessed data and instructions to reduce access time. It is classified into levels, such as L1 (Level 1), L2 
(Level 2), and L3 (Level 3) cache, based on proximity to the processor.

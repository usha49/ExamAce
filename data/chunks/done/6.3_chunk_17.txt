What are the differences between simple FSAs and a Turing machine? 
4. What is the only possible action when the head is at the left end symbol of the tape? 
5. Is it allowed to write the left end symbol on the tape? 
 
Computing with Turing Machines 
Introduction 
FSAs : Stop when the input has been consumed.  If the state is final - the string is accepted, if not 
- the string is rejected. 
Turing machines: the tape is infinite.  
Halting states - to stop the machine.

Pictorial views, including perspective and oblique
projections, are used to present objects in a way that closely resembles how they appear to the
human eye. These views are commonly used in presentations and design concepts to provide a
more realistic representation of an object.
Sectional drawings are used to reveal the internal features of an object by cutting through it and
displaying a cross-sectional view.

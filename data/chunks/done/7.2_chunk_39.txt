This is the basic principle of hashing. This way, we
can access any record in a specific time without making any comparison, irrespective of the
number of record in the file. Hashing is a scheme of searching that will use some function say
hash to directly find out the location of the record in a constant search time, no matter where the
record is in the file. In order words the process of mapping large amount of data into a smaller
table is called hashing.

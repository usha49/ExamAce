i.e.
             P  =    x             T  =    tx             P’  =     x’
                        y                        ty                          y’	
	
	
	
	
	
.
  so we can write
              P’  =  P + T

Scaling 
This transformation changes the size of an object
Such that we can magnify or reduce its size 
In case of polygons scaling is done by multiplying coordinate values (x,y) of each vertex by scaling factors sx sy to 
produce the final transformed coordinates (x’,y’).
 sx scales object in ‘x’ direction
 sy scales object in ‘y’ direction
or      
    P  =   x              T   =   sx    0            P’  =     x’
              y                        0    sy                         y’
or 
            		
 x’              sx    0        x
             		
 y’      =      0    sy  .

Internetworking & Devices: Repeaters, Hubs, Bridges, Switches, Router, Gateway 
Repeaters are used in transmission systems to replicate or regenerate analog or digital signals distorted 
by transmission loss. Analog Repeaters frequently can only amplify the signal while Digital Repeaters can 
reconstruct a signal to near its original quality. In a data network, a repeater can relay messages 
between subnetworks that use different protocols or cable types.

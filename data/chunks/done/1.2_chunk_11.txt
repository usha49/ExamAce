These circuits are fundamental in the design of 
filters, oscillators, and tuning circuits in communication systems.
resonance in AC series and parallel circuit
Resonance in AC circuits occurs when the inductive reactance and capacitive 
reactance become equal, resulting in a purely resistive impedance at a specific 
frequency known as the resonant frequency.

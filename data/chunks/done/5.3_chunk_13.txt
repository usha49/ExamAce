Routing Protocols: RIP, OSPF, BGP, Unicast and Multicast Routing Protocols 
RIP (Routing Information Protocol) is the distance vector routing protocol which means that each router 
may not know where the final destination network is, but it does know in which direction it exists and 
how far away it is. It employs the hop count as the routing metrics. Hop count is the number of a router 
the packet must travel till it reaches its destination.

2.1 Digital Logic
Digital logic forms the core of computing and electronics, using number systems, logic levels,
logic gates, Boolean algebra, and simplification methods like Karnaugh maps. Number systems
in digital logic include decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal. The decimal system, used in
everyday life, is base 10 with digits from 0 to 9. The binary system, fundamental to digital
circuits, operates with only two digits: 0 and 1.

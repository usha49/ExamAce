In power applications, 
MOSFETs are used in DC-DC converters, inverters, and motor control circuits due 
to their high efficiency and fast switching capabilities. In analog circuits, 
they serve as amplifiers and variable resistors, while in digital circuits, 
MOSFETs act as the building blocks of logic gates and memory cells.
Application of CMOS
CMOS technology is integral to modern electronics, finding applications in both 
digital and analog domains.

When a key
value hashes and collision occurs for key, this method probes the table location at(h (k) + 12) %
table-size,(h (k) + 22) % table-size,(h (k) + 32) % table-size and so on.Double Hashing:When
collision occurs, a new hash function is defined.H2(key) = R â€“ (key%R)Where R is the nearest
prime number from its table size.Rehashing: If at any stage the hash table become almost full
(when packing density is more than 70%) then it will be difficult to find the free slot which will
increase execution time.

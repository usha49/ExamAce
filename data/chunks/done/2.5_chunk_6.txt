Interfacing I/O and Memory 
Interfacing in a microprocessor system refers to the connection between the microprocessor, memory, 
and peripheral devices to facilitate data transfer. Memory interfacing involves connecting external 
memory modules to the processor's address, data, and control buses. The processor selects memory 
locations using the address bus, transfers data through the data bus, and manages read/write operations 
using control signals such as RD (Read) and WR (Write).

Although multiple transactions may execute concurrently, each

Intermediate transaction results must be
hidden from other concurrently executed transactions.
That is, for every pair of transactions Ti and Tj, it appears to Ti
that either Tj, finished execution before Ti started, or Tj started execution after Ti finished. Durability.

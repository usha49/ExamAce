1. Concept of Basic Electrical and Electronics Engineering     
1.1 Basic concept: 
OhmÂ´s law
Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering that explains the 
relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electric circuit. 
According to this law, the current passing through a conductor is directly 
proportional to the voltage across its ends and inversely proportional to the 
resistance offered by the conductor.

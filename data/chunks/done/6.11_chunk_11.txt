The objects comprising a set are called its 
elements or members. For example, b is an element of the set L; in symbols, b є  L. Sometimes 
we simply say that b is in L, or that L contains b. On the other hand, z is not an element of L, and 
we write z є  L. 
Singleton set 
A set may have only one element; it is then called a singleton. For example, {1} is the set with 1 
as its only element; thus {1} and 1 are quite different.  
Empty set 
There is also a set with no element at all.

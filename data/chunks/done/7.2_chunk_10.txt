Some of them are described in this section.Adjancency
matrix:Adjancency matrix A for a graph G = (V, E) with n vertices, is n x n matrix, such that Aij
= 1, if there is an edge from vi to vj Aij = 0, if there is no such edge.It is a simple way to
represent a graph, but it has following disadvantages:it takes O(n2) space,it takes O(n2) time to
solve most of the problems.Adjacency List Representation:The n rows of an adjacency matrix
can be represented as n linked lists.

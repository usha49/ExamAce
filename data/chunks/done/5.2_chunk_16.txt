PPP supports multiple 
network layer protocols and is widely used for LAN-to-WAN connections. 
The Media Access Control (MAC) layer handles shared physical connections among multiple computers. 
It is responsible for addressing, channel access control, and managing collisions. Ethernet, IEEE 802.3, is 
a widely used MAC protocol employing Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection 
(CSMA/CD). Other MAC protocols include ALOHA, CSMA, and Token Ring.

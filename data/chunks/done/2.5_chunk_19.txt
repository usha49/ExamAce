Introduction to Direct Memory Access (DMA) and DMA Controllers 
Direct Memory Access (DMA) is a high-speed data transfer technique that allows peripherals to send or 
receive data directly from memory without involving the microprocessor. This reduces CPU workload 
and improves system efficiency, especially in applications requiring large data transfers, such as disk 
operations and video processing.

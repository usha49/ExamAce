However, beyond a certain reverse 
voltage, known as the breakdown voltage, the diode conducts heavily, which may 
damage it unless it is designed for such conditions (e.g., Zener diodes).
Semiconductor diodes are fundamental in power conversion, signal demodulation, 
and protection circuits.
BJT Configuration and biasing
The bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a three-layer semiconductor device 
consisting of two p-n junctions.

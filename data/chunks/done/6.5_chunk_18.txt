Composite Transformation
With the matrix representation of transformation equations it is possible to setup a matrix for any sequence of 
transformations as a composite transformation matrix by calculating the matrix product of individual 
transformation.
For column matrix representation of coordinate positions we form composite transformation by multiplying 
matrices in order from right to left.

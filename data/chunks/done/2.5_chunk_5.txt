At the top 
of the hierarchy is the processor register, which has the fastest access time but limited storage. Below 
that is cache memory, followed by RAM, which provides more storage but has slower access times. 
Finally, secondary storage devices such as HDDs and SSDs provide massive storage capacity but are 
significantly slower compared to RAM and cache.

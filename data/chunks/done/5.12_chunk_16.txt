In summary, the physical layer is the foundation of network communication, ensuring that data is 
transmitted accurately over various transmission media. It defines the hardware specifications, encoding 
techniques, transmission methods, and switching technologies required for effective communication. 
The choice of transmission media and switching techniques depends on factors such as bandwidth 
requirements, distance limitations, interference susceptibility, and cost considerations.

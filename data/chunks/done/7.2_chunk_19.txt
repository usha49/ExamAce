Problem
involving fares can be modeled by assigning fares to the edges.Thus, we can model airplane or
other mass transit routes by graphs and use shortest path algorithm to compute the best route
between two points.Similarly, if the vertices represent computers; the edges represent a link
between computers; and the costs represent communication costs, delay costs, then we can use
the shortest-path algorithm to find the cheapest way to send electronic news, data from one
computer to a set of other computers.Basically, there are three types of shortest path
problems:Single path: Given two vertices, s and d, find the shortest path from s to d and its
length (weights).Single source: Given a vertex, s find the shortest path to all other vertices.All
pairs: Find the shortest path from all pair of vertices.Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the shortest
path:Mark all the vertices as unknown;for each vertex v keep a distance dv from source vertex s
to v initially set to infinity except for s which is set to ds = 0;repeat these steps until all vertices
are known:select a vertex v, which has the smallest dv among all the unknown vertices;mark v
as known;for each vertex w adjacent to v;if w is unknown and dv + cost(v, w) < dw update dw to
dv + cost(v, w).Greedy Algorithm:One of the simplest approaches that often leads to a solution
of an optimization problem.

Compare the middle element with an item.There are three cases.If
it is a desired element then search is successful,If it is less than the desired item then search only
in the first half of the array.If it is greater than the desired item, search in the second half of the
array.Repeat the same steps until an element is found or search area is exhausted.In this way, at
each step we reduce the length of the list to be searched by half.Requirements The list must be
ordered,Rapid random access is required, so we cannot use binary search for a linked
list.Algorithm Let 'aâ€™ be the array of size 'Maxsize' and 'LB', 'UB' and 'mid' are variables to
denote first, last and middle location of a segment.

Microinstruction Format
Microinstructions are the lowest-level instructions that define the operations 
of a CPU. The format of a microinstruction includes fields specifying the 
control signals for hardware units, the address of the next microinstruction, 
and any additional data required for execution. Common formats include 
horizontal and vertical microinstruction encoding.

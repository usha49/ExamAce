The concatenation of strings x and y written xoy or simply xy is the string x 
followed by the string y.  
Formally w=xy if and only  if |w| =|x| + |y|, w(j)= x(j) for j=1 â€¦ , |x| and w(|x|+j)=y(j) for j=1 , 
|y|. 
e.g 01o 001=01001 
woe=eow =w for any string w . concatenation is associative i.e (wx)y= w(xy) for any string w, 
x,y.  
 
Suffix:  
If w=xy for some x, then y is a suffix of w. 
Prefix: 
If w=xy for some y, then x is a prefix of w.

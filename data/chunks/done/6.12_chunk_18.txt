 
The automaton, as it reads the input string, may choose at each step to go into anyone of these 
legal next states; the choice is not determined by anything in our model, and is therefore said to 
be nondeterministic. 
 
Nondeterministic devices are not meant as realistic models of computers. They are simply a 
useful notational generalization of finite automata, as they can greatly simplify the description of 
these automata.

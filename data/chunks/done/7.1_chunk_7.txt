The main operations performed on a queue include inserting an
element at the rear, removing an element from the front, and checking if the queue is empty.
Queues are commonly used in scheduling tasks, handling requests in operating systems, and
managing buffers.

Stacks are particularly useful in expression evaluation. Infix expressions, where operators
appear between operands (e.g., A + B), can be converted into postfix notation (e.g., AB+) using
stacks.

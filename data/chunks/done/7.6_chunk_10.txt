File allocation methods determine how file data is stored on disk and
include contiguous allocation, where files are stored in continuous blocks, leading to fast
access but possible fragmentation; linked allocation, where each file is stored as a linked list of
disk blocks, eliminating fragmentation but slowing down access due to pointer traversal; and
indexed allocation, where an index block contains pointers to all the fileâ€™s data blocks, providing
direct access to any block.
The impact of the allocation policy on fragmentation is significant, as different allocation
methods lead to varying levels of fragmentation.

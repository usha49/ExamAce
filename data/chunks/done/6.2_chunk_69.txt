 All regular grammars are linear, but not all linear grammars are regular! 
 
Example 1: 
Let G = (V, ∑, R, S)   where  
V= { A,B,S, a,b} 
∑= { a, b} 
 
R= 
{  
S  abA/B/baB/e 
A  bS

Right Linear Grammars 
Right-linear: at most one variable on the right side of the production must be the right-most 
symbol. 
A  xB 
A  x 
x is any string of terminals.

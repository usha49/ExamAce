Multiprocessing 
systems can be:
Symmetric (SMP): All processors share the same memory and perform identical 
tasks.
Asymmetric (AMP): Processors are specialized for specific tasks, with one acting 

as the master.
Multiprocessing enables load balancing, fault tolerance, and efficient 
utilization of system resources.
Multitasking 
Multitasking allows a CPU to handle multiple tasks or processes seemingly 
simultaneously by rapidly switching between them.

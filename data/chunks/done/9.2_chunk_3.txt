Each state
represents a partial solution, and operators add components to the solution while ensuring
constraints are not violated.
Components of CSP:
Variables: Elements to be solved for.
Domains: Possible values each variable can take.
Constraints: Restrictions on the values that variables can simultaneously take.
Example: In the 8-queens problem, variables represent queen positions, domains are the board
coordinates, and constraints ensure no two queens threaten each other.
Uninformed Search Techniques
These strategies do not utilize additional information about states beyond what is provided in the
problem definition.
Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.
Characteristics:
Uses a stack data structure (LIFO).
Can get trapped in deep or infinite branches.
Memory efficient but not guaranteed to find the shortest path.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all nodes at the present depth before moving to nodes at the
next depth level.
Characteristics:
Uses a queue data structure (FIFO).
Guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
Can consume significant memory for wide or infinite state spaces.
Depth-Limited Search (DLS): DFS with a predetermined depth limit to prevent infinite descent.
Characteristics:
Limits how deep the search can go.
Addresses infinite path issues but may miss solutions deeper than the limit.
Iterative Deepening Search (IDS): Combines the benefits of DFS and BFS by incrementally increasing
the depth limit.
Characteristics:
Performs DLS repeatedly with increasing depth limits.
Finds the shortest path with less memory usage than BFS.
Bidirectional Search: Simultaneously searches forward from the initial state and backward from the
goal state, meeting in the middle.

Characteristics:
Can significantly reduce search time.
Requires both forward and backward search capabilities.
Informed Search Techniques
These strategies utilize problem-specific knowledge (heuristics) to find solutions more efficiently.
Greedy Best-First Search: Selects the node that appears to be closest to the goal based on a heuristic.
Characteristics:
Uses a priority queue ordered by the heuristic function.
Can be fast but is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution.
A Search:* Combines the cost to reach a node and the estimated cost from that node to the goal.

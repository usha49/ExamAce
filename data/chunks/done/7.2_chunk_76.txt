Heap Sort Efficiency:
No of comparisons and assignments Worst-case: O(nlogn) ;Average case: O(nlogn).
Hence time complexity of heap sort is O(nlogn) for both worst case and average
case and space complexity is O(1). In average case, it is not as efficient as quick sort,

Soring
16
however, it is far superior to quick sort in worse case.

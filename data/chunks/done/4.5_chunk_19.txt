The control 
action is described as:
u(t)=Kp e(t)+Ki â «e(t)dt+Kd de(t)/dt

â
Where:

u(t): Control output.
e(t): Error signal.
K p,Ki,Kd: Proportional, integral, and derivative gains.
Feedforward Control: Uses knowledge of the system to preemptively adjust inputs 
without relying on feedback.
Adaptive Control: Adjusts control parameters dynamically to handle system 
variations or disturbances.
Applications:
Control systems are vital in industries such as:
Automotive: Anti-lock braking systems and engine control units.
Aerospace: Flight stabilization and autopilot systems.
Manufacturing: Robotic arm movement and conveyor belt operations.

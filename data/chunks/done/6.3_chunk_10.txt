Configuration: determined by the current state, the state of the tape, and the position of the 
head. 
e.g . (q1, 
 # a ) is a configuration. (written informally) 
Formal definition of a configuration: 
Let M = (K, ∑, δ, s, H) be a Turing machine. A configuration of M is a member of 
K x 
∑* x (∑* (∑ - {#})  {e}) 
When M is in a given configuration C1 and we apply the transition function, another 
configuration C2 is obtained.

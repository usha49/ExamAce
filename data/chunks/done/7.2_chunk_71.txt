Merge Sort can prove
superior over other sorting algorithms when used with linked lists.Binary Tree
Sort:General idea is to create a binary search tree and access the elements either in
LVR and RVL for ascending and descending order.But, in case of imbalanced tree
(right skewed and left skewed), the search time goes approximately n2. Therefore, to
minimize the search time, AVL trees are maintained. This will increase performance
up to nlogn.

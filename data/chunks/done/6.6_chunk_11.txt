Coordinate axes Rotations: 
 2D z-axis rotation equations are easily extended to 3D: 
    x’ =   xcosθ  -  ysinθ                 y’ =   xsinθ  +  ycosθ                      z’ =   z  …………(i) 
 
3D z-axis rotation equations are expressed in homogenous coordinate form as 
 
      x’          cosθ    -sinθ      0      0              x 
      y’    =    sinθ     cosθ      0      0      .

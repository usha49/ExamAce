Common algorithms include Least Recently Used (LRU), 
which removes the least recently accessed data; First-In-First-Out (FIFO), which 
removes the oldest data; and Random Replacement, which evicts a randomly chosen 
block. The choice of algorithm affects cache efficiency and system performance.
Write policy
Write policies dictate how data modifications are handled in the cache and main 
memory.

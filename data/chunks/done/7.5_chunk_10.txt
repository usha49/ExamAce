Thus,
the programs that do not require interaction are well served by batch OS. Since the jobs
are executed in the FIFO manner, the batch OS require very simple CPU scheduling
techniques. In addition, batch system allow only one user program to reside in the
memory at a time, thus memory management is also very simple affairs in batch OS.
Since only one program is in execution at a time any time critical device management is
not required, which simplifies the I/O management.

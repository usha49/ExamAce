Conversions between star and 
delta are particularly important in electrical engineering to analyze power 
distribution systems and ensure proper load balancing in three-phase circuits.
 Kirchhoffâ€™s law
Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) states that in any closed-loop circuit, the sum of 
the potential differences (voltages) is zero. This law is essential for 
analyzing energy conservation within circuits.

Communication between the microprocessor and other system components occurs through a system 
bus. The address bus carries memory addresses from the processor to memory and peripherals. The 
data bus transfers data between components, while the control bus sends control signals to manage 
operations such as reading and writing data. These buses enable synchronous and asynchronous 
communication between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices, ensuring efficient processing.

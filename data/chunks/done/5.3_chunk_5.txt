A bridge maintains a MAC 
address table for both LAN segments it is connected to. A bridge has a single incoming and outgoing 
port. It filters traffic on the LAN by looking at the MAC address. Data filtering is done by the bridge, 
which looks at the destination address before forwarding, unlike a hub. It restricts transmission on other 
LAN segments if the destination is not found.

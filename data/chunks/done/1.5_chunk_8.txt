This natural frequency acts as the resonant 
frequency of the oscillator circuit. Crystal oscillators are known for their 
precision and are commonly used in applications requiring stable timing and 
frequency control, such as clocks, microprocessors, and communication systems. 
The Pierce Oscillator is a popular circuit configuration for crystal 
oscillators, combining the crystal with an amplifier and feedback network.

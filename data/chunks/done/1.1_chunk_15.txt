Understanding these distinctions is crucial in modern electronics, 
where non-linear components play a central role in devices like amplifiers and 
signal processors.
 bilateral and unilateral circuits
Bilateral circuits allow current to flow equally well in both directions, making 
their behavior symmetric regardless of the current's direction. Examples include 
circuits with resistors or capacitors.

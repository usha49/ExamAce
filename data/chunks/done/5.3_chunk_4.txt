They are very efficient by forwarding good 
packets selectively to correct devices only by checking MAC address in a table, otherwise, they transmit 
to all. Switches can support both layer 2 (based on MAC Address) and layer 3 (Based on IP address) 
depending on the type of switch. Usually, large networks use switches instead of hubs to connect 
computers within the same subnet. 
Bridges are Data Link Layer devices. A bridge is more complex than a hub.

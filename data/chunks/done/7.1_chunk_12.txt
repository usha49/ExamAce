Deletion can be performed by removing nodes from specific positions.
Doubly linked lists are particularly useful in applications requiring bidirectional traversal, such as
 navigation in web browsers and undo-redo operations in text editors.
There are different types of linked lists. A singly linked list consists of nodes where each node
points to the next node in the sequence.

Registers find applications in temporary data storage, signal processing, and
communication systems.
Counters, which count events in digital systems, are categorized into asynchronous (ripple) and
synchronous counters. Asynchronous counters have flip-flops triggered sequentially,
introducing delays due to signal propagation. Synchronous counters trigger all flip-flops
simultaneously with a common clock signal, improving speed and reliability.

Note that unlike the 
finite automaton, a PDA is assumed to be nondeterministic unless we state otherwise. 
Condition 2 prevents the possibility of a choice between a move independent of the input 
symbol (e-move) and a move involving an input symbol.  
For finite automata, the deterministic and nondeterministic models were equivalent with respect 
to the languages accepted. The same is not true for PDA. In fact wwR is accepted by a 
nondeterministic PDA, but not by any deterministic PDA.

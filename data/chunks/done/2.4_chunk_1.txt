Chapter 1: Introduction 
A microprocessor is an integrated circuit that contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry 
necessary to perform computing tasks. It acts as the brain of a computing system, executing instructions 
stored in memory and managing data flow between different components. The microprocessor operates 
in binary, using a series of 0s and 1s to represent digital signals.

The basic 
steps followed by TCP to establish the connection are as follows: Step 1: Client end system sends 
SYNchronize packet to server. Step 2: Server end system receives SYN, replies with SYNchronize-
ACKnowledgement. Step 3: Client receives SYN-ACK and sends ACKnowledge to server, and Server 
receives ACK.

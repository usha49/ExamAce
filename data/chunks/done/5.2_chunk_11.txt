The checksum method divides data into sections, adds them using oneâ€™s 
complement arithmetic, and complements the result to create a checksum. 
Error control mechanisms include Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ), where data retransmission occurs 
in case of damaged frames, lost frames, or lost acknowledgements. Retransmission is triggered by three 
cases: damaged frames, lost frames, and lost acknowledgements. ARQ techniques include Stop-and-
Wait ARQ, Go-Back-N ARQ, and Selective Repeat ARQ.

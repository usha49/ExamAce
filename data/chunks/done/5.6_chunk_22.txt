VPNs use tunneling protocols such as Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), Layer 2 
Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), and OpenVPN to secure data transmission. Organizations use VPNs to enable 
remote employees to access internal resources securely. 
As cyber threats continue to evolve, network security remains a top priority for individuals, businesses, 
and governments.

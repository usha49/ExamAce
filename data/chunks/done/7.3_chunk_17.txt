The evaluation of
expressions involves converting high-level SQL queries into efficient execution plans using
optimization techniques.
Query optimization is the process of improving query performance by selecting the best
execution strategy. It involves techniques such as indexing, query rewriting, using efficient joins,
and eliminating unnecessary computations. Query decomposition breaks complex queries into
smaller subqueries, allowing for efficient processing and retrieval of results.

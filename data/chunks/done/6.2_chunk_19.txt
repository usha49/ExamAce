The only realistic way to 
recognize a string of a context-free grammar is to parse it. 
 
A parse tree is a convenient way to represent a derivation of a particular string.  
A ‘derivation tree’ is an ordered tree which the  nodes are labeled with the left sides of 
productions and in which the children of a node represent its corresponding right sides. 
Formal Definition 
Let G = (V, ∑, R, S) be a CFG.

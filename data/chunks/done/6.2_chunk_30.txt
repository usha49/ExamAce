In the next stage, the production A CbAA is replaced by A   CbD1 and 
D1   A A, and the production B CaBB is replaced by B  CaD2 and D2  BB 
The productions for the grammar in CNF are shown below. 
S CbA/CaB 
A CaS/  CbD /  a 
B  CbS/CaD2/ b 
D1   AA 
D2 BB 
Ca  a 
Cb b

Pushdown Automata(PDA) 
Consider the language L1 L1={ WCWR : W ∈ ∑ *   or  L2= { anbn :    n≥ 1 }, these languages are 
generated by CFG but can't be accepted by FA.

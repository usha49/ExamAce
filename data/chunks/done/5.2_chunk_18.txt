These include Random 
Access Protocols (e.g., ALOHA, CSMA), Channel Partitioning Protocols (e.g., TDMA, FDMA, CDMA), and 
Controlled Access Protocols. Ethernet technology is widely used in LANs and MANs, defined by IEEE 
802.3 standards. Token Ring (IEEE 802.5) uses token passing for network access control, while Token Bus 
(IEEE 802.4) combines Ethernet and Token Ring characteristics.

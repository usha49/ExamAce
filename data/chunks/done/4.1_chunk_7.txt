Horizontal encoding provides 
detailed control at the cost of longer instruction widths, while vertical 
encoding is more compact but requires decoding stages. The choice of format 
affects the speed and complexity of the control unit.
Design of control unit
The control unit (CU) is responsible for interpreting instructions from memory 
and generating control signals to execute them. There are two main types of 
control unit designs: hardwired and microprogrammed.

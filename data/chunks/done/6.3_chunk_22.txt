ï‚· If the string is not in L, the machine either rejects it or never halts. 
Definition: A language is called recursively enumerable, if there is a Turing machine that 
semidecides it. 
(Strings in the language are accepted, strings that are not in the language may be rejected or may 
cause the Turing machine to go into an infinite loop.) 
Each Turing machine M defines a recursively enumerable language: the set of all strings 
accepted by M.

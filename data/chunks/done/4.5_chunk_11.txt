Common scheduling algorithms include:
First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS): Tasks are executed in the order they arrive.
Shortest Job Next (SJN): Executes the shortest task first, minimizing average 
wait time.
Round Robin (RR): Allocates a fixed time slice to each task in a cyclic manner.
Priority Scheduling: Tasks with higher priority are executed before lower-
priority ones.
Real-Time Scheduling: Focuses on meeting deadlines, with algorithms like Rate-
Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF).
Task Synchronization
Task synchronization ensures that multiple tasks access shared resources safely 
without conflicts.

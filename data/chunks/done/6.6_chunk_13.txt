Cyclic permutation of the coordinate parameters x , y and z are used to get transformation equations for 
rotations about the other two coordinates                       
                                                x  y  z   
 
so, 
substituting permutations in (i) for an x axis rotation we get, 
    y’ =   ycosθ  -  zsinθ                 z’ =   ysinθ  +  zcosθ                      x’ =  x  
  
3D x-axis rotation equations in homogenous coordinate form as 
 
      x’          1     0         0         0 
x 
      y’    =   0   cosθ   -sinθ     0     .

Unilateral circuits, however, permit 
current to flow in only one direction, as seen in components like diodes. These 
classifications are significant in designing circuits for specific 
functionalities, such as rectifiers or filters.
 active and passive circuits
Active circuits contain components like voltage sources or transistors that can 
inject energy into the circuit, enabling signal amplification or oscillation.

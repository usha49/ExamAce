For instance, an alternating voltage can 
be expressed as ( )=
 sin⁡(

the angular frequency,t is time, and ϕ is the phase angle. The waveform of 
alternating voltage or current is typically represented as a sine wave, which 
alternates between positive and negative values, completing a full cycle in one 
period.

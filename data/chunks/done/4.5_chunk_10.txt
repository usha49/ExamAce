This is achieved through 
context switching, where the OS saves the state of one task and loads the state 
of another. Multitasking can be:
Preemptive: The OS forcibly interrupts a task to switch to another.
Cooperative: Tasks voluntarily yield control to the OS.
Multitasking enhances system responsiveness and resource utilization.
Task Scheduling 
Task scheduling determines the order and timing of task execution to optimize 
system performance.

The CPU's primary function is to execute instructions by 
following the fetch-decode-execute cycle. Modern CPUs incorporate advanced 
features like multiple cores, caches, and pipeline architectures to enhance 
performance and efficiency.
Arithmetic and logic Unit
The arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is a critical component of the CPU that 
performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division, as well as logical operations such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.

Department of Defenseâ€™s VHSIC (Very High-Speed Integrated Circuits) program, 
VHDL allows designers to describe hardware at various abstraction levels, 
including behavioral, dataflow, and structural.
VHDL supports:
Simulation: Testing and verifying digital designs before implementation.
Synthesis: Translating the high-level description into a gate-level design for 
implementation on FPGAs or ASICs.
Portability: Designs can be reused across different hardware platforms.
VHDL designs are written in entities and architectures:
Entity: Defines the interface of the digital module, including input and output 
ports.
Architecture: Describes the internal behavior or structure of the module.
Example of a simple VHDL entity for an AND gate:
entity AND_Gate is
  Port ( A : in STD_LOGIC;
         B : in STD_LOGIC;
         Y : out STD_LOGIC);
end AND_Gate;
Overflow:
Overflow occurs in digital arithmetic when the result of an operation exceeds 
the range that can be represented by the available number of bits.

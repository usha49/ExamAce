The rapid development of new technologies has introduced both
opportunities and challenges for engineers, requiring continuous learning and adaptation.
Engineers must stay updated with emerging trends, such as smart cities, green energy solutions,
and sustainable construction methods, to remain competitive in the industry.
Occupational health and safety (OHS) is a critical aspect of engineering professional practice,
ensuring that workplaces are free from hazards that could cause injuries or illnesses.

Serial Interface 
A serial interface is a communication system in which data is transmitted one bit at a time over a single 
communication line. Serial communication is commonly used in networking, telecommunications, and 
data transfer between microcontrollers and external devices. The key advantages of serial 
communication include reduced hardware complexity, lower cost, and longer transmission distances 
compared to parallel communication.

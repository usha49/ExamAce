The Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol enables two parties to securely share encryption keys over an 
insecure network. The process involves selecting a large prime number and a base, which are publicly 
shared. Each party chooses a secret number and calculates a public value by raising the base to the 
power of their secret number modulo the prime. The shared secret key is derived by raising the received 
public value to the power of the secret number.

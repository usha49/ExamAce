Concatenation operation 
If L1 and L2 are languages over   , their concatenation is L = L1.L2 or L1L2 where  
L= { w є  *  : w  = xy for some x  є L1 and y є L2 } 
e.g = { 0,1} 
L1= { w є  *   : w has an even number of 0's} 
L2= { w є  *   : w  starts with a 0 and the rest of the symbols are 1's } 
then  
L1L2= { w є  *   : w  has an odd number of 0's } 
2. Kleene star

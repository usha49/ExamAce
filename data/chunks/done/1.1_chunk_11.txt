These two 
configurations form the basis for analyzing and designing complex electrical 
networks.
star-delta and delta-star conversion
Star and delta configurations are methods of connecting components in three-
phase electrical systems. Star, or Y, configuration connects one end of each 
component to a common point, forming a Y shape, while delta connects the 
components in a triangular loop. These configurations can be interchanged using 
specific formulas to simplify circuit analysis.

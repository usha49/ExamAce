The general setting is the same as with all FSAs : 
 a control unit, 
 a tape 
 a head that reads form or writes onto the tape 
 the control unit has states and a transition function to move from one state to another 
there is one initial state and a set of halting states 
The difference: 
The head can write on the tape 
The head can move in both directions - right and left. 
The tape: 
 Bound to the left, infinite to the right. 
 Consists of cells (also called squares).

Left Regular Grammars: 
Rules of the forms 
 
A → ε 
 
A → a 
 
A → Ba 
 
A, B: variables (Non terminals) and 
a: terminal 
 
Prove: All right-linear grammars describe regular languages 
 Idea: Find a way to convert any right-linear grammar into a FSA. 
o Terminals before a non-terminal represent arcs 
o Non-terminals represent non-final states. 
o Terminals without non-terminals following represent final states.

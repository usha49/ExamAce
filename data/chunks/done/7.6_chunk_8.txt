Common page
replacement algorithms include FIFO (First-In-First-Out), where the oldest page is replaced first;
LRU (Least Recently Used), which replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time;
Optimal Page Replacement, which replaces the page that will not be needed for the longest time
in the future; and Clock Algorithm, a modification of LRU that uses a circular queue and a
reference bit to track page usage.
File systems provide a structured way to store, organize, and retrieve data on storage devices.

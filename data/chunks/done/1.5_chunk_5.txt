However, their 
frequency range is limited compared to other types of oscillators.
Basic Principles of LC Oscillators
LC oscillators use inductors (L) and capacitors (C) to form a resonant circuit 
that determines the oscillation frequency. When the circuit is energized, energy 
oscillates between the magnetic field of the inductor and the electric field of 
the capacitor, producing a sinusoidal waveform.

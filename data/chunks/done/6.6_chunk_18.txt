Making an arbitrary axis passing thru origin coincident with one of the coordinate axes requires two 
successive rotations about the other two coordinate axes. 
 
To make arbitrary rotation axis  coincident with 
the rotation angle, about the x axis used to place the  
arbitrary axis in the xz plane, first project the unit  
vector along the axis onto the yz plane.

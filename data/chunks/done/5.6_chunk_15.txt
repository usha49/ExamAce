The RSA algorithm is commonly used for secure transactions, digital signatures, and encrypted 
communication. The algorithm generates public and private keys by selecting large prime numbers. 
Encryption involves raising the plaintext to an exponent, modulo a product of primes. Decryption 
reverses this process using the private key. The RSA algorithm provides strong security but requires 
significant computational power for encryption and decryption.

Specifically, let M = (K, , Г, ∆, s, F), where 
 
K = Kl x K2, the Cartesian product of the state sets of Ml and M2; 
f = f 1 ; 
s = (Sl, S2); 
F = Fl X F2, and 
∆, the transition relation, is defined as follows.  
For each transition of the pushdown automaton ((ql, α,, β), (pl, γ))  є  ∆, and for each state q2 є 
K2, we add to ∆.

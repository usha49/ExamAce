The indegree of
a vertex v is the number of edge entering v. The outdegree of a vertex v is the number of
edges leaving v. The sum of the indegrees of all the vertices in a graph equals to the sum
of outdegree of all the vertices.
Undirected Graph:If the directions are not marked for any edge, the graph is called
undirected graph. The graphs G1, G2, G3 are undirected graphs.

Initially each node is considered to be a partial tree. Each partial
tree is maintained in a queue Q. Priority queue is associated with each partial tree, which
contains all the arcs ordered by their weights.Shortest Path Algorithm:There are many
problems that can be modeled using graph with weight assigned to their edges. Eg, we may set
up the basic graph model by representing cities by vertices and flights by edges.

2.2 Combinational and Arithmetic Circuits
Combinational circuits generate outputs based solely on current inputs without memory
elements. Multiplexers, demultiplexers, decoders, and encoders are widely used in digital
systems for data selection and encoding functions. A multiplexer, often called a data selector,
takes multiple input signals and routes only one to the output based on control signals.

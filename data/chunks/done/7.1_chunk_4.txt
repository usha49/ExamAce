Time
complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of the input
size. It is expressed using asymptotic notation such as Big-O, which represents the worst-case
scenario, Omega, which represents the best-case scenario, and Theta, which represents the
average-case scenario. Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires
for execution, including both fixed and variable memory allocations.

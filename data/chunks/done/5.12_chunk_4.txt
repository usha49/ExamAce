Data transmission involves sending bits in a structured 
manner, ensuring that they reach the destination accurately. Synchronization ensures that both the 
sender and receiver agree on the timing of data transmission, preventing errors due to mismatches in 
signal interpretation. Transmission rates define the speed at which data is sent over the network, 
typically measured in bits per second (bps).

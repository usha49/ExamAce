animation may require an object to be 
translated , rotated etc in a sequence.
For an animation that requires scaling, rotation, translation, instead of applying each transformation one at a time 
separately we can combine them so that final coordinates are obtained directly from initial coordinates thus 
eliminating intermediate steps.
Here, incase of homogenous coordinates we add a third coordinate ‘h’ to a point (x,y) so that each point is 
represented by (hx, hy, h).
‘h’ is normally set to 1.
If points are expressed in homogenous coordinates, all geometrical transformation equations can be represented as 
matrix multiplications.
Coordinates of a point are represented as three element column vectors, transformation operations are written as 3 x 
3 matrices.
So, for translation we have
   	
	
  	
 x’              1     0     tx        x
            		
  	
 y’     =       0     1     ty   .

To prove this property, P 
using mathematical induction following are the steps:  
Basic Step: 
First show that property P is true for 0 or 1 
Induction Hypothesis: 
Assume that property P holds for n 
Induction Step:  
Using induction hypothesis, show that P is true for n+1 
Then by the principle of mathematical induction, P  is true for all natural numbers 
Example 
Let us show that for any n ≥ 0, 1+2+3+…………………+ n  =  
 
Basic Step. Let n=0.

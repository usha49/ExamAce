It assumes a 
predictable relationship between input and output but does not adjust its 
behavior based on actual performance.
Characteristics of Open-Loop Control Systems:
No Feedback: The system lacks a feedback loop to monitor or correct output.
Simple Design: The absence of feedback makes the system easier to design and 
implement.
Low Cost: Fewer components are needed, making it cost-effective.
Limited Accuracy: Open-loop systems cannot compensate for disturbances or 
changes in system dynamics.
Examples:
A toaster operates for a fixed time based on the userâ
s input, regardless of 

the actual toasting level.
Traffic lights operate on a predefined timer without sensing real-time traffic 
conditions.
Mathematical Representation
Open-loop systems can be described by a transfer function, G(s), representing 
the system's response to an input X(s): Y(s)=G(s)â
X(s) Where Y(s) is the 

output.
Close-Loop control System overview
A close-loop control system uses feedback to compare the actual output with the 
desired reference input.

MOSFETs are characterized by high input impedance, fast switching, and 
low power consumption.
Working principle of CMOS
Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology combines NMOS and PMOS 
transistors in a complementary arrangement to form logic gates and other 
circuits. The principle of operation relies on the complementary switching 

behavior of NMOS and PMOS transistors. When one transistor is on, the other is 
off, ensuring minimal power consumption.

Why Threads?
Process with multiple threads makes a great server (e.g. print server) . Increase
responsiveness, i.e. with multiple threads in a process, if one threads blocks then other
can still continue executing . Sharing of common data reduce requirement of inter-
process communication. Proper utilization of multiprocessor by increasing concurrency .
Threads are cheap to create and use very little resources. Context switching is fast (only
have to save/reload PC, Stack, SP, Registers).

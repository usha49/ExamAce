Manipulation operations include arithmetic and logical processing of data. 
Efficient data transfer mechanisms, such as direct memory access (DMA) and cache 
memory, are critical for high-performance computing. Manipulation instructions 
enable complex computations, including arithmetic calculations, bitwise 
operations, and data formatting.
 RISC and CISC 
Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) and Complex Instruction Set Computing 
(CISC) are two architectural paradigms for CPUs.

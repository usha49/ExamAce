Together, these 
concepts form the backbone of circuit analysis, helping engineers understand and 
predict the behavior of electrical systems.
power and energy
Electric power represents the rate at which electrical energy is converted into 
another form of energy, such as heat, light, or motion. It is a critical concept 
in understanding the efficiency and functionality of electrical devices. Power 
depends on both the voltage supplied and the current flowing through a device.

Destruction is assumed to be detectable: disk drives use checksums to detect
failures. Recovery and Atomicity: To ensure atomicity despite failures, we first output information
describing the modifications to stable storage without modifying the database itself. We study log-based recovery
mechanisms in detail We first present key concepts And then present the actual recovery algorithm .Less used alternative:
shadow-paging.Log Based Recovery: A log is kept on stable storage.

Integrity constraints are rules that maintain the accuracy and consistency of data in
a database. These include domain constraints, which specify the valid values for an attribute,
referential integrity, which ensures consistency in foreign key relationships, and entity integrity,
which ensures that primary key values are unique and not null.
Relations in a database refer to tables that store data.

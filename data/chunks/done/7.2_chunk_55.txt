At each pass, each element in
the list is compared to its successor and they are interchanged if they are not in proper order. At
each pass, one element will be in its proper positions. In general, A[n-i] will be in its place after
pass i. Since each pass place a new element in its proper position, a total of N-1 passes are
required for a list of N elements.

Deterministic PDA (DPDA) 
 
 A PDA is deterministic if there is at most one move for any input symbol, any top stack 
symbol and at any state 
 A no move or move without advancing input string are possible in a deterministic PDA 
 A move without advancing input string implies that no other move exists 
 The PDA for WCWR   is deterministic 
 The set of languages accepted by DPDA's is only a subset of language accepted by non 
deterministic PDA 
 A regular languge is language accepted by a DPDA 
 Not all language accepted by DPDA are regular 
 All languages accepted by DPDA have an unambiguous VFG 
 Not all unambiguous languages are accepted by DPDA.

This theorem is limited to linear systems where the 
principle of superposition applies.
 Thevenin`s theorem
Thevenin's theorem is another powerful tool used in circuit analysis, 
particularly for simplifying complex networks. According to this theorem, any 
linear electrical network with voltage sources and resistances can be 
represented as an equivalent circuit with a single voltage source in series with 
a resistance.

A real-time system is defined as a data processing system in
which the time interval required to process and respond to inputs is so small that it
controls the environment. It is a multitasking operating system that aims at executing real-
time applications.
Real-time
operating
systems
often
use specialized
scheduling
algorithms so that they can achieve a deterministic nature of behavior. The main object of
real-time operating systems is their quick and predictable response to events.

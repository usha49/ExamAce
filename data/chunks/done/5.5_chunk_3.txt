File Transfer: FTP, PuTTY, WinSCP 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) helps a user to transfer text-based or binary files across the network. A 
user can use this protocol in either GUI-based software like FileZilla or CuteFTP and the same user can 
use FTP in Command Line mode. 
PuTTY is a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console, and network file transfer 
application. It supports several network protocols, including SCP, SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and raw socket 
connection.

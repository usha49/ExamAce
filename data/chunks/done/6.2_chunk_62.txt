Then we claim that L(G) = L(G1)     L(G2) For the only rules involving S are S  S1 and S 
S2,  
so S  * G    w   if and only if either S1  * G    w  or  S2  * G    w  and since G1 and G2 have 
disjoint sets of non-terminals, the last disjunction is equivalent to saying that w є L(G1)   L(G2 
).

Concatenation 
 
The construction is similar: L(G1) .L(G2)  is generated by the grammar G =(V, ∑,  R, S)    where  
V= V1    V2  S 
∑= ∑1   ∑2 
R= RI U R2   {S  S1 S2}.

Byte 
stuffing, or Character Stuffing, recognizes frame boundaries using flag bytes, inserting an escape byte 
before any flag byte in the data. Physical Layer Coding Violations apply to networks where data 
encoding on the physical medium contains redundancy. 
Error detection and correction mechanisms are used to ensure accurate transmission. Errors can be of 
three types: single-bit errors, multiple-bit errors, and burst errors.

If the hash function produces collisions, we create a new hash table of
double size. We may use the old hash value on input to a rehash function and compute a new
hash value. For rehashing with linear probing, we can use the rehash function as:(old hash value
+ constant) % array-size Where constant and array size are relatively prime, i.e, the largest
number that divides both of them is 1.

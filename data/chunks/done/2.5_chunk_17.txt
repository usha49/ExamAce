This method is 
commonly used in RS-232 serial communication and UART-based systems. 
Serial Interface Standards 
Several standardized protocols define the specifications for serial communication. RS-232 
(Recommended Standard 232) is a widely used serial communication standard for connecting 
computers and peripherals. It operates at baud rates ranging from 110 to 115,200 bps and supports 
asynchronous communication.

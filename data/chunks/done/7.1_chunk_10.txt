A dynamic list structure allows memory
allocation and deallocation as needed. Linked lists are an example of dynamic list structures,
where elements (nodes) can be added or removed without predefined constraints on size.
A linked list consists of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in
the sequence.

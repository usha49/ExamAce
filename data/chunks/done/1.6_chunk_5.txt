As a result, Class C amplifiers are limited to RF and high-frequency 
applications where signal fidelity is less critical, and the focus is on power 
efficiency.
Class A Output Stage
The Class A output stage operates with the active device (usually a transistor) 
biased in such a way that it remains in the active region throughout the entire 
input signal cycle. This ensures continuous conduction and minimizes distortion.

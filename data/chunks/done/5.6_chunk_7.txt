Cryptography plays a crucial role in network security by transforming readable data (plaintext) into an 
unreadable format (ciphertext) using encryption algorithms. Encryption ensures that unauthorized users 
cannot access sensitive information. Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and 
decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of public and private keys for secure 
communication.

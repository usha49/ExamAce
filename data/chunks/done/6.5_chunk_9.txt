Rotate in anti-clockwise direction by same angle
here, 
R   =     cosθ     sinθ           R’   =     cosθ    -sinθ       
            -sinθ     cosθ                         sinθ     cosθ    
For reflection against x-axis,
R f =     1    0
             0    1
       so for  θ = 45 we get
R(y = x)  =      0     1

(v).Reflection about line  y = -x
Steps required:
i.  Rotate about origin in clockwise direction by 45
 ii. Take reflection against y-axis

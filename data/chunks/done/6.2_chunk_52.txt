The Languages of a PDA 
We have assumed that a PDA accepts its input by consuming it and entering an accepting state. 
We call this approach acceptance by final state. We may also define for any PDA the language 
accepted by empty stack, that is, the set of  strings that cause the PDA to empty it stack, starting 
from the initial ID.

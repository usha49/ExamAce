It defines the physical characteristics of network hardware such as 
cables, connectors, switches, and wireless transmitters. The primary role of the physical layer is to 
ensure the correct transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between connected devices. It 
establishes the electrical and mechanical interfaces, the transmission medium, the data encoding 
scheme, and the signal transmission techniques.

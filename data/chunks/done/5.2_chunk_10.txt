Error detection allows the receiver to 

check whether the received data is corrupted and may request retransmission. Error correction allows 
the receiver to reconstruct the original information when errors occur. Common error detection 
methods include Parity Check and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). Parity Check adds an extra bit to 
make the number of 1s even or odd, while CRC involves binary division of the data bits, using a divisor 
generated by polynomials.

A
file is a collection of related data stored under a specific name, while a directory is a container
that holds files and other directories. File paths specify the location of a file in the directory
hierarchy, either as an absolute path (full path from the root directory) or a relative path (path
relative to the current directory).
File system implementation involves organizing files and directories efficiently to allow quick
access and retrieval.

Projects can be categorized as public or private, infrastructure or technology-based,
and short-term or long-term.
The project life cycle consists of multiple phases, including initiation, where project feasibility
and objectives are defined; planning, where detailed scheduling, budgeting, and resource
allocation take place; execution, where actual work is carried out and project deliverables are
produced; monitoring and control, where progress is tracked and necessary adjustments are
made; and closure, where final evaluations and documentation are completed.
Project scheduling involves organizing tasks and activities in a structured manner to ensure
efficient progress.

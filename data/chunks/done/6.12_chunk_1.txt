Chapter 2 :Finite Automata 
2.1 Finite Automata 
Automata are computational devices to solve language recognition problems. Language 
recognition problem is to determine whether a word belongs to a language.   
Automaton = abstract computing device, or “machine” 
An automaton is an abstract model of a digital computer.

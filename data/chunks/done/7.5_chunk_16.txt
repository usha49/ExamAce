The main difference between Multiprogrammed
Batch Systems and Time-Sharing Systems is that in case of multiprogrammed batch
systems, the objective is to maximize processor use, whereas in Time-Sharing Systems,
the objective is to minimize response time. Multiple jobs are executed by the CPU by
switching between them, but the switches occur so frequently. Thus, the user can receive
an immediate response.

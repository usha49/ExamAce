If d(v) = 1, v is pendent.
Weighted Graphs:A graph is said to be weighted graph if every edge in the graph is
assigned some weight or value. The weight is a positive value that may represent the
cost of moving along the edge, distance between the vertices etc.The two vertices with
no edge (path) between them can be thought of having an edge (path) with weight
infinite.
Adjacent and Incident: Two vertices i and j are called adjacent if there is an edge
between the two. Eg.

Physical data independence
ensures that changes to the internal schema, such as indexing and storage structures, do not
impact the logical schema.
A database schema represents the structure of a database, defining tables, attributes, and
relationships. It remains fixed for a given database, providing a logical framework for organizing
data. An instance, on the other hand, refers to the actual data stored in the database at a
specific moment in time.

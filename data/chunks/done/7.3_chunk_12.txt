There are different types of relations,
including joined relations, which combine data from multiple tables using join operations, and
derived relations, which are created using SQL queries and views. SQL (Structured Query
Language) provides powerful commands for defining, manipulating, and querying data. SQL is
divided into Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).

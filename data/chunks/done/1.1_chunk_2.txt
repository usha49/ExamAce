This relationship remains valid as long as 
the physical conditions, such as temperature, remain constant. This law is 
instrumental in understanding and designing electrical circuits, as it provides 
a basis for calculating any one of the three variables if the other two are 
known. The unit of resistance, the ohm, is named after Georg Simon Ohm, who 
formulated this principle.

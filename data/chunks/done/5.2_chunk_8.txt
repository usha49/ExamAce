The 
Character Count method uses a field in the header to specify the number of characters in the frame but 
can fail if the count is distorted in transit. Bit stuffing allows frames to contain an arbitrary number of 
bits and character sizes. Each frame begins and ends with a special bit pattern called a flag byte. When 
five consecutive 1s are encountered in the data, a '0' bit is stuffed into the outgoing bit stream.

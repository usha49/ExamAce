The design of the control unit significantly impacts the CPU's 
performance, flexibility, and complexity.
CPU Structure and Function
The central processing unit (CPU) consists of three primary components: the 
control unit (CU), arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), and registers. The CU 
manages instruction decoding and execution, while the ALU performs arithmetic 
and logical operations. Registers provide high-speed storage for intermediate 

data and instructions.

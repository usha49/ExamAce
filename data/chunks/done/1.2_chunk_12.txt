In series resonance, the total 
impedance of the circuit is minimized, and the current is maximized, making it 
useful in applications such as tuning radio frequencies. In contrast, parallel 
resonance occurs when the circuit impedance is maximized, and the current is 
minimized, which is often used in power systems to limit unwanted currents.

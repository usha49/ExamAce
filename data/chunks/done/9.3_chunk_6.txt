Rule-Based Systems
Uses "if-then" rules to represent knowledge.
Example: "If temperature > 30Â°C, then turn on the fan."
Advantages: Simple and effective for expert systems.
Disadvantages: Scalability issues with large rule sets.
5. Probabilistic Representations
Uses probability theory to handle uncertainty.
Example: Bayesian Networks.
Advantages: Suitable for uncertain and incomplete knowledge.
Disadvantages: Computationally intensive.

A half-adder adds two single-bit binary numbers, producing a sum and a carry output,
while a full-adder extends this by adding three bits, including a carry from the previous stage.
Multi-bit adders such as ripple-carry adders combine multiple full-adders for complex
calculations.
Binary subtraction can be performed directly or using the twoâ€™s complement method.

for bad moves the
probability is low and for comparatively less bad moves, it is higher.

• Probability of downward steps is controlled by temperature parameter.
High temperature implies high chance of trying locally "bad" moves, allowing
nondeterministic exploration.
• Low temperature makes search more deterministic (like hill-climbing).
• Temperature begins high and gradually decreases according to a predetermined annealing
schedule.
• Initially we are willing to try out lots of possible paths, but over time we gradually settle
in on the most promising path.
• If temperature is lowered slowly enough, an optimal solution will be found.
• In practice, this schedule is often too slow and we have to accept suboptimal solutions.
Applications of Simulated Annealing Search
VLSI layout problem
Factory scheduling
Travelling salesman problem
Local beam search
• A path based algorithm
• Keeps track of k states rather than just one
• Starts with k randomly generated states
• At each iteration, all the successors of all k states are generated.
• If anyone is a goal state, stop, else select the k best successors from the complete list and
repeat.
Adversarial Search
Competitive environments in which the agents goals are in conflict, give rise to adversarial
search, often known as games.
In AI, games means deterministic, fully observable environments in which there are two agents
whose actions must alternate and in which utility values at the end of the game are always equal
and opposite.

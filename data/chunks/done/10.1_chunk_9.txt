This method is essential in technical
drawings, as it provides accurate measurements and eliminates perspective distortion.

Isometric projection or isometric view is a technique used to illustrate a three-dimensional
object in a way that all three axes appear equally inclined at 120 degrees to each other. This
projection helps engineers and designers visualize objects more effectively, particularly in
mechanical and architectural drawings.

In digital circuits, CMOS is used in 
microprocessors, microcontrollers, and digital signal processors due to its low 
power consumption and high integration density. Analog CMOS circuits are 
employed in mixed-signal applications, such as data converters, operational 
amplifiers, and filters. The combination of low cost, high efficiency, and 
scalability makes CMOS a cornerstone of semiconductor technology.

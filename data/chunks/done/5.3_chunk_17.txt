Without it, 
we wouldnâ€™t be able to do a Google search or send an email. Neighboring BGP routers i.e. BGP peers 

exchange detailed path information. It is also called the path vector routing algorithm. The protocols are 
more concerned with reachability than optimality. 
Routing Algorithms: Shortest Path Algorithm, Flooding, Distance Vector Routing, Link State Routing; 
Protocols: ARP, RARP, IP, ICMP 
Flooding is the simplest method of packet forwarding.

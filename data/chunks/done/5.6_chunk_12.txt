Virtual Private 
Networks (VPNs) create secure tunnels for remote access, enabling users to connect to private networks 
over the internet while maintaining confidentiality and integrity. 
Wireless network security is essential due to the vulnerability of wireless communication to 
eavesdropping and unauthorized access. Wireless Encryption Protocol (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access 
(WPA) secure wireless networks by encrypting data transmitted over Wi-Fi.

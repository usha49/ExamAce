so, 
               cos   =  cz/d           sin       =       cy/d                               
so, transformation matrix for rotation about x axis is: 
 
                 1     0         0       0                         1     0          0        0                            
Rx(  )  =   0   cos    -sin       0                         0     cz/d   -cy/d     0                           
                 0    sin     cos      0                         0     cy/d     cz/d    0                           
                 0      0       0        1                         0     0           0       1 
 
 
 
After rotation about the x axis into  
the xz plane, the z component of the  
unit vector is d, and x component is 
cx (the direction cosines) 
 
Rotation angle     about the y axis  
required to make the arbitrary axis  
coincident with the z axis is  
   cos     =    d                   sin        = cx 
 
so, transformation matrix for rotation about y axis is: 
 
                 cosθ     0       sinθ       0                         d        0         -cx        0                            
Ry(θ)  =    0         1           0         0                          0        1          0         0                           
                 sinθ     0        cos(θ)    0                         cx       0          d          0                    
                  0         0           0         1                          0        0          0         1 
 
required translation matrix is  
 
                 1    0    0    x0     
                 0    1    0    y0             
 T   =        0    0    1    z0             
                 0    0    0    1               
finally, 
rotation about the arbitrary axis  is given by z axis rotation matrix,

                    cosθ    -sinθ      0      0               
  Rz(  )   =    sinθ     cosθ      0      0              
                     0          0          1      0              
                     0          0          0      1               
 
so the transformation matrix for rotation about an arbitrary axis then can be expressed as the composition of 
these seven individual transformations: 
                         R(θ)  = T-1 .

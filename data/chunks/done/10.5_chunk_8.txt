Engineers
must design safe working environments, provide protective equipment, and implement risk
mitigation measures. Safety training, emergency response planning, and compliance with OHS
regulations help prevent workplace accidents and ensure employee well-being.
The Nepal Engineers Association (NEA) is the primary professional organization representing
engineers in Nepal. It plays a vital role in promoting professional development, ethical practices,
and policy advocacy.

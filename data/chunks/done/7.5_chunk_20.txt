They either
have an event-driven design or a time-sharing one. An event-driven system switches
between tasks based of their priorities while time-sharing operating systems switch tasks
based on clock interrupts : Hard real-time systems guarantee that critical tasks complete
on time. In hard real-time systems, secondary storage is limited or missing and the data is
stored in ROM. In these systems, virtual memory is almost never found. Soft real-time
systems are less restrictive.

Operators are pushed onto a stack while operands are directly placed in the output. In
postfix evaluation, the operands appear before the operator, making computation
straightforward using a stack. The operands are pushed onto the stack, and whenever an
operator is encountered, the required number of operands is popped, the operation is performed,
and the result is pushed back.
Lists can be implemented using arrays or linked structures.

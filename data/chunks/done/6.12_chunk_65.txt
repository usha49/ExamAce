To show this: 
– Show we can express a DFA as an equivalent RE 
– Show we can express a RE as an e-NFA. Since the e-NFA can be converted to a DFA and the 
DFA to an NFA, then RE will be equivalent to all the automata we have described. 
 
 
Theorem : A language is regular if and only if it is accepted by a finite automaton.

In I/O-
mapped I/O, separate address space is allocated for I/O devices, requiring special instructions such as IN 
and OUT for data transfer. 

Handshaking mechanisms are often used in I/O interfacing to synchronize data exchange between the 
processor and peripheral devices. Interrupt-driven I/O and Direct Memory Access (DMA) are advanced 
interfacing techniques that improve data transfer efficiency by reducing the microprocessorâ€™s 
involvement in handling I/O operations.

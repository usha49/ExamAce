An execution starts with the configuration (q0, s, ε), i.e., the machine is in the start state, the input 
string s is on the tape, and the stack is empty. A successful execution is one which finishes in a 
configuration where s has been completely read, the final state of the machine is an accept state, 
and the stack is empty.

Design a pushdown automaton M to accept the language L = {WcWR : w ∈ {a, b } *}.

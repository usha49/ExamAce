Coaxial cables have a 
central conductor surrounded by an insulating layer, a metallic shield, and an outer protective cover. 
They offer better bandwidth and noise resistance than twisted pair cables and are commonly used for 
cable television and broadband internet. Fiber optic cables use light signals to transmit data through 
glass or plastic fibers.

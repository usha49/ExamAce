The product-of-sums (POS) method represents a Boolean function as a product of
maxterms, where each term consists of OR combinations of input variables that result in a low
output. Truth table rows with an output of 0 contribute to the POS expression.
A truth table lists all possible input combinations and their corresponding outputs, helping in
circuit design and verification.

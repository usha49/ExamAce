If M is in state q є K and the symbol read from the input tape is a є ∑, then δ(q, a) є K is the uniquely  
determined state to which K passes. 
 
The transition from one internal state to another are governed by transition function δ.  
If δ (q0, a) q1    then if the DFA is in state q0 and the current input symbol is 'a' the DFA will go into state 
q1   . 
 
Configuration of DFA 
 
A configuration is determined by the current state and the unread part of the string being processed.

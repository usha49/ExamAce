Depending on the application, 
embedded systems can be simple microcontroller-based setups or complex, multi-
processor systems.
Classification of Embedded Systems
Embedded systems can be classified based on their functionality, performance, 
and application:
Real-Time Embedded Systems: Operate under strict timing constraints.

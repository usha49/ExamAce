Parse/ derivation Trees 
Parsing 
A compiler translates code written in a programming language into another form, usually one 
more suitable for execution. To do so the compiler extracts the meaning of the code to be 
compiled in a process called parsing.  “Parsing” a string is finding a derivation (or a derivation 
tree) for that string.  Parsing a string is like recognizing a string.

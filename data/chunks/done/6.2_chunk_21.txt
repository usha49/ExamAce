an  
  A leaf labeled l has no siblings, that is, a vertex with a child labeled e can have no other 
children. 
 
For example, in the grammar 
A  0A1 
A  B 
B  # 
Derivation of the string 000#111 is given by the tree: 
 
 
 
 
Formally, for an arbitrary context-free grammar G = (V, ∑, R, S), we define its parse trees and 
their roots, leaves, and yields, as follows. 
1. This is a parse tree for each  a є ∑. The single node of this parse tree is both the root and 
a leaf.

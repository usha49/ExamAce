This process is often conceptualized as a search through a state
space, where each state represents a possible configuration of the system.
Problem as a State Space Search
In this framework, a problem is defined by:
Initial State: The starting point of the problem.
Goal State: The desired outcome.
State Space: The set of all possible states reachable from the initial state.
Operators: Actions that transition the system from one state to another.
Path Cost: A numerical value representing the cost associated with a path from the initial to the
current state.
The objective is to find a path from the initial state to the goal state with minimal path cost.
Problem Formulation
Formulating a problem involves:
Defining the State Space: Identifying all possible states.
Specifying the Initial State: Determining where the problem-solving process begins.
Defining the Goal Test: A function to determine if a given state is the goal state.
Identifying Operators: Actions available to transition between states.
Assigning Path Costs: Evaluating the cost associated with each action or sequence of actions.
A well-formulated problem provides a clear roadmap for the search process.
Well-Defined Problems
A problem is well-defined if it has:
Clear Initial State: Unambiguously specified starting point.
Explicit Goal State: Clearly defined desired outcome.
Defined State Space: Comprehensive set of all possible states.
Known Operators: Clearly specified actions for state transitions.

Deterministic Outcomes: Actions have predictable effects.
Examples include puzzles like the 8-queens problem or the traveling salesman problem.
Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
A CSP is a problem where the solution must satisfy a set of constraints or conditions.

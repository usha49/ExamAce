Common formats include fixed-length and variable-length instructions. 
Fixed-length instructions simplify decoding but may waste memory space, while 
variable-length instructions optimize memory usage but require more complex 
decoding. The choice of format depends on the CPU architecture and its intended 
applications.
Addressing modes
Addressing modes define how operands are specified in instructions. Common modes 
include immediate, direct, indirect, register, and indexed addressing.

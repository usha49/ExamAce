The vertices are
represented by points or circles and the edges are line segments connecting the vertices.
If the graph is directed, then the line segments have arrow heads indicating the direction.
Directed Graphs: If every edge (i, j), in E(G) of a graph G is marked by a direction
from i to j, then the graph is called directed graph. It is often called diagraph. In edge e =
(i, j), we say, e leaves i and enters j. In diagraphs, self loops are allowed.

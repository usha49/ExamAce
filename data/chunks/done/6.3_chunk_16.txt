Problem 
Consider a machine that scans to the left until it finds a blank, and then stops 
∑ = {a, □, ∆} 
K = {q0, h} 
H = {h} 
s = q0 
Transition function: 
state 
q 
symbol 
σ 
Transition  
δ(q , σ ) 
q0 
a 
(q0, ←) 
q0 
□ 
(h, □) 
q0 
∆ 
(q0, →) 
Trace the operation if M is in q0, and the tape is ∆ a a □ 
Will the machine stop? (the answer is: no)

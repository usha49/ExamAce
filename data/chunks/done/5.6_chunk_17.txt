This shared key is used for encrypted communication. 
Digital signatures play a vital role in ensuring data authenticity and integrity. A digital signature is 
created by generating a hash of the message and encrypting it with the sender’s private key. The 
recipient verifies the signature by decrypting the hash with the sender’s public key and comparing it to 
the computed hash of the received message.

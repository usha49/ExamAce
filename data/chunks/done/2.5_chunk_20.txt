A DMA controller manages the data transfer process by requesting access to the system bus, performing 
the memory transaction, and notifying the processor upon completion. The Intel 8237 DMA controller is 
a commonly used chip that supports multiple DMA channels, enabling concurrent data transfers. 
DMA operations can be classified into burst mode, cycle stealing mode, and transparent mode. In burst 
mode, the DMA controller transfers a block of data in a single operation.

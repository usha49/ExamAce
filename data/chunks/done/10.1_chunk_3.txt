Proper organization of a drawing sheet ensures clarity and consistency in
technical documentation.
Dimensions in engineering drawings represent the measurable attributes of an object, including
lengths, widths, diameters, and angles. Proper dimensioning follows international standards like
ISO 129 and ASME Y14.5, ensuring uniformity across different engineering fields.

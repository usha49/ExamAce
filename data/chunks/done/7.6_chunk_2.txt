Memory addressing can be physical or logical, where
logical addresses are mapped to physical addresses using the memory management unit
(MMU).
Swapping is a memory management technique where processes are temporarily moved from
main memory to secondary storage (such as a hard disk) to free up space for other processes.
When required, the process is swapped back into memory for execution.

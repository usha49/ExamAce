1.4 Semiconductor devices:
Semiconductor diode and its characteristics
A semiconductor diode is a two-terminal electronic device made from a p-n 
junction, where one side is doped with acceptor atoms (p-type) and the other 
with donor atoms (n-type). This configuration allows current to flow primarily 
in one direction, making it a key component in rectification processes.

Karnaugh maps (K-maps) provide a visual method for simplifying
Boolean expressions by grouping adjacent 1s into larger blocks, reducing the number of logic
gates required. A four-variable K-map consists of a 4x4 grid where adjacent cells differ by only
one bit, allowing efficient grouping and minimization of logic expressions.

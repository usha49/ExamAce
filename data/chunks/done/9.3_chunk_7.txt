Issues in Knowledge Representation
Expressiveness:
The ability of a representation to capture complex real-world knowledge.
Example: Predicate Logic is more expressive than Propositional Logic.
Efficiency:
The computational complexity of reasoning with the representation.
Example: Semantic networks are efficient for simple queries but may struggle with complex
inferences.
Ambiguity:
Handling vague or uncertain information.
Example: Probabilistic representations are better suited for ambiguous data.
Scalability:
The ability to handle large amounts of knowledge.
Example: Rule-based systems may become inefficient as the number of rules grows.

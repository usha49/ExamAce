The large-signal model, on the other hand, is used to 
analyze the transistor's behavior when significant variations in current and 
voltage occur, such as in switching applications. These models are indispensable 
in designing and analyzing amplifiers, oscillators, and other analog circuits.
Working principle of MOSFET
The metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) is a voltage-
controlled device widely used in analog and digital circuits.

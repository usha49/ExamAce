This approach selects the best choice at each step, instead of
considering all sequences of steps that may lead to an optimal solution. Algorithm that make
what seems to be the “best” choice at each step are called greedy algorithm.Transitive
Closure:In all shortest path, we noticed that every time we have to determine whether there is a
path from vertex i to j. This can be accomplished by observing a matrix, say d(n). The path exists
if and only if the entry does not have the value infinity.

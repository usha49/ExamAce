Satellite communication involves transmitting signals to satellites in orbit, which then relay the signals to 
ground stations. This technology enables global communication, making it essential for television 
broadcasting, GPS, and remote internet access. 

Multiplexing is an essential technique in the physical layer that allows multiple signals to share a single 
transmission medium, improving efficiency and reducing costs.

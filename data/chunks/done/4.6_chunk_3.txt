This issue is 
critical in designs involving fixed-point and signed arithmetic.
Signed Overflow: Happens when the result of a signed operation exceeds the range 
defined by the number of bits.
Unsigned Overflow: Occurs when an operation on unsigned numbers produces a carry 
beyond the most significant bit (MSB).
In VHDL, overflow detection can be implemented using:
Carry Detection: For unsigned operations.
Sign Bit Analysis: For signed operations, where the sign bit of the result 
differs unexpectedly from the expected sign.
Example of detecting overflow in VHDL:
signal overflow: STD_LOGIC;
overflow <= (A(MSB) and B(MSB) and not Sum(MSB)) or
            (not A(MSB) and not B(MSB) and Sum(MSB));
Data representation using VHDL:
VHDL provides robust mechanisms for representing and manipulating data types, 
including:
Scalar Types: Represent individual values, such as BIT, STD_LOGIC, INTEGER, and 
REAL.
Composite Types: Include arrays and records for grouping multiple values.
Enumeration Types: Allow custom-defined values, like STATE_TYPE with values 
IDLE, READ, and WRITE.
Signed and Unsigned Types: Represent binary numbers for arithmetic operations.

These waveforms are fundamental to understanding AC systems, as they 
define how voltage and current behave over time.
Average, Peak and RMS values
In AC systems, the average value, peak value, and root mean square (RMS) value 
are essential metrics for analyzing and describing alternating voltages and 
currents. The peak value is the maximum magnitude of the waveform, representing 
the highest voltage or current attained during a cycle.

 If the input symbol does not match the top stack symbol,  no further operation is 
possible 
 IF an automaton M reaches in configuration (f, e, e) , final state, end of input , empty 
stack , then the input was indeed of the form WcWR 
 
 
Example 2 
Design a PDA M that accept a language given by L= { anbn :    n ≥ 1 } . 
Solution 
Let required PDA,   M= (K, ∑, Г ,∆ , S , F) where  
K = {s , q, f} 
∑= {a,b} 
Г= {a} 
F = {f} and  
∆  is given by following five transitions

Understanding these materials is vital for 
selecting the appropriate components in electrical and electronic design.
Series and parallel electric circuits
In a series circuit, components are connected end-to-end in a single path, so 
the same current flows through each component. However, the voltage across each 
component varies depending on its resistance. Series circuits are commonly used 
in applications where a consistent current is required.

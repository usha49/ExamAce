Formally for I ≥ 0 ,we define Ei(S) inductively to be the set of states reachable from s via exactly 
i many  e-transitions,  so that E0(s)=s and for I ≥ 0  
Ei+1(s) =   { r ∈ Q  |  Eq ∈  Ei(s)  : r ∈ δ (q, e) }

Namely, the set of all states reachable from s via zero or more e-transitions.  
e-closure(q0 ) denotes a set of all vertices p such that there is a path from q0 to p labeled .

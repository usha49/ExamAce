Resonance phenomena are critical in the design and analysis of AC circuits for 
achieving desired frequency responses.
 
active and reactive power
In AC circuits, the concept of power is divided into active and reactive power. 
Active power, measured in watts, represents the real power consumed by resistive 
elements to perform useful work.

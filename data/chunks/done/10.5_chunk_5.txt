Engineers must
prioritize public welfare over personal or corporate interests and report any unethical practices
that could endanger lives or harm the environment.
The regulatory environment in engineering consists of laws, standards, and policies that govern
the profession. Compliance with building codes, safety regulations, and environmental laws is
mandatory to ensure the quality and safety of engineering projects.

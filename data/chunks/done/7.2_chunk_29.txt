After, we have, by recursion
placed all the successors of a vertex into the topological order, then place the vertex itself in the
order (before any of its successors).Determining the Depth First Topological ordering:Fill the
information from the graph into the table( Vertices, Successors and Successor count),Push all
the vertices into stack and visit the vertex that is on the top.Decrement the Successor count
value by 1 where ever the visited vertex appears in the Adjacent Successor vertices
column.Repeat until all the vertices has been visited.

Searching is a process of finding an element within the list of elements stored in any order.
Searching is divided into two categories.

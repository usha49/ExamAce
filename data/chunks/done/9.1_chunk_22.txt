Their behavior is defined by
condition-action rules, also called production rules or if-then rules.
These agents are the simplest type but are limited in environments
that require memory or knowledge of past states.
Key Characteristics:
No internal model of the world.
Works best in fully observable environments.
Fails in partially observable or dynamic environments.
Efficient for straightforward, repetitive tasks.
Model Based,
Model-based reflex agents maintain an internal model of the
environment.

Each process has a lifecycle with distinct states:
New: Process is being created.
Ready: Process is waiting for CPU allocation.
Running: Process is executing on the CPU.
Blocked/Waiting: Process is waiting for an I/O operation or event to complete.
Terminated: Process execution is completed.
Processes are isolated, and inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, such 
as shared memory, message passing, or pipes, are used for collaboration between 
processes.
Threads 
Threads are lightweight processes that share the same address space but have 
independent execution flows.

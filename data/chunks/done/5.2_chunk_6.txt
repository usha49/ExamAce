The frame is formed by breaking down a stream of packets into smaller, digestible chunks. It typically 
includes synchronization features that indicate to the receiver the beginning and end of the payload 
data within the stream. In the OSI model, a frame is the protocol data unit at the data link layer, 
representing the final encapsulation before transmission over the physical layer. A frame consists of a 
link-layer header followed by a packet, separated by an interframe gap.

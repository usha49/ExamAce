4.1 Control and central processing units:
 Control Memory
Control memory is a specialized memory used in microprogrammed control units of 
CPUs. It stores the microinstructions that define how a processor executes 
instructions. These microinstructions specify control signals for various 
hardware components, orchestrating their operations to perform tasks like data 
movement, arithmetic operations, and branching.

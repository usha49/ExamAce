The trade-off between 
efficiency and maximum power is an important consideration, as achieving maximum 
power does not necessarily imply maximum efficiency.
 R-L, R-C, R-L-C circuits
Circuits containing combinations of resistors, inductors, and capacitors, such 
as R-L, R-C, and R-L-C circuits, exhibit unique characteristics depending on 
their configurations and the type of current applied. R-L circuits consist of a 
resistor and inductor in series or parallel.

Conductors, such as copper and silver, have 
a high density of free electrons that can move freely under the influence of an 
electric field, making them ideal for electrical wiring and connections. 
Insulators, such as rubber and glass, lack free electrons and resist the flow of 
electric current. They are essential for ensuring safety and preventing unwanted 
current flow in electrical systems.

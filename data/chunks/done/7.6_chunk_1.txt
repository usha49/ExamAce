Memory Management, File Systems, and System Administration
Memory management is a crucial function of an operating system that ensures efficient
allocation and deallocation of memory resources to different processes. It manages the primary
memory (RAM) to optimize system performance while preventing conflicts and ensuring
stability. The memory address is the unique location assigned to each memory cell, allowing the
processor to access and manipulate data.

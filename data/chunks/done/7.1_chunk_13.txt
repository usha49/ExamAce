A doubly linked list contains two pointers, one pointing
to the next node and another pointing to the previous node, allowing bidirectional traversal. A
circular linked list is where the last node of the list points back to the first node, creating a
circular connection. Circular linked lists can be singly or doubly linked.

A tree is a hierarchical, non-linear data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. The
top node is called the root, and every node can have child nodes.

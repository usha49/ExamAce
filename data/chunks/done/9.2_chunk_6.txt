Ridge: Where there are steep slopes and the search
direction is not towards the top but towards the
side.
Simulated Annealing Search
• Idea: escape local maxima by allowing some "bad" moves but gradually decrease their
frequency
• Instead of restarting from a random point, we allow the search to take some downhill
steps to try to escape local maxima.
• A random pick is made for the move
• If it improves the situation, it is accepted straight away
• If it worsens the situation, it is accepted with some probability less than 1 which
decreases exponentially with the badness of the move i.e.

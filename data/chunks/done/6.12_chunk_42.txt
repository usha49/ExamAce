Similarly, 
there is an NFA M2 = (K2,∑, δ2, q2, F2), such that L2 = L(M2).  
We may assume that K1 ∩ K2 = ∅, (K1 and K2 are disjoint sets) because otherwise, we can give 
new “names” to the states of K1 and K2. 
From these two NFAs, we will construct an NFA M = (K, ∑, δ, q0, F), such that L(M) = L1 ∪ 
L2. The construction is illustrated in Figure 2.1. The 
NFA M is defined as follows: 
1. K = K1 ∪ K2 ∪ {q0}, where q0 is a new state. 
2. q0 is the start state of M. 
3. F = F1 ∪ F2. 
4.

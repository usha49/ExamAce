Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees,
and graphs. Abstract Data Types (ADTs) define logical data structures without specifying their
implementation details. ADTs include lists, stacks, queues, and trees, which specify the
operations that can be performed rather than how they are implemented in memory.
The efficiency of an algorithm is measured in terms of time and space complexity.

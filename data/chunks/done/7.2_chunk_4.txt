In an undirected graph,
we say that an edge e = (u, v) is incident on u and v (u and v are connected).
Undirected graph donâ€™t have self loops. Incidence is a symmetric relation i.e. if e = (u, v)
Then u is a neighbor of v and vice versa. The degree of a vertex, d(v), is the total
number of edges incident on it.
The sum of the degrees of all the vertices in a graph equals twice the number of edges if
d(v) = 0, v is isolated.

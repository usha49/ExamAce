An example of such a problem is “Is an arbitrary mathematical statement true or false?” To 
attack such a problem, we need formal definitions of the notions of 
 computer, 
 algorithm, and 
 computation. 
The theoretical models that were proposed in order to understand solvable and unsolvable 
problems led to the development of real computers. 
Central Question in Computability Theory: Classify problems as being solvable or unsolvable.

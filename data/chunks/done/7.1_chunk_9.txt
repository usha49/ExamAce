An array-based implementation
stores elements in a fixed-size sequential block of memory, whereas a linked list dynamically
allocates memory. Stacks and queues can also be implemented as lists, where stacks allow
only push and pop operations at one end, while queues allow insertion at the rear and removal
from the front.
A static list structure has a fixed size, meaning memory is allocated at the time of declaration
and cannot be changed later. Examples include arrays.

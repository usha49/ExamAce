The whirlwind computer developed in 1950 at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had computer driven CRT displays for output. The 
SAGE air-defense system developed in the middle 1950s was the first to use command and 
control CRT display consoles on which operators identified targets with light pens (hand held 
pointing devices that sense light emitted by objects on the screen) Later on Sketchpad system by 
Ivan Sutherland came in light.

The channel allocation 
problem involves managing shared broadcast channels among multiple users. Static channel allocation 
methods like Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) and Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) waste 
bandwidth in dynamic environments. Dynamic allocation methods like ALOHA and CSMA are more 
efficient. 
Multiple Access Protocols regulate transmission on shared broadcast channels.

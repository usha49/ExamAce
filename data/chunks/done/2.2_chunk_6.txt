In twoâ€™s
complement, the negative of a number is obtained by inverting all bits and adding 1, allowing
subtraction to be handled as addition. Unsigned binary numbers represent only positive values,
while signed binary numbers use different methods to indicate positive and negative values. In
sign-magnitude representation, the most significant bit (MSB) denotes the sign, with 0
indicating positive and 1 indicating negative.

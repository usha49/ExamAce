It involves encoding information
about the world into a format that machines can understand and manipulate.
Purpose
Facilitates reasoning and decision-making by providing a structured way to store and retrieve
knowledge.
Enables machines to interpret and understand complex information.
Mappings
Real-world to Symbolic Representation:
Translates real-world entities (e.g., objects, events) into symbolic forms (e.g., variables, predicates).
Example: Representing "It is raining" as a proposition RR.
Symbolic to Computational Representation:
Encodes symbols into data structures (e.g., graphs, logical formulas) that computers can process.
Example: Representing relationships between objects using a graph structure.

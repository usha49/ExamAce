Internet address may also refer to the 
name or IP of a Web site (URL), someoneâ€™s e-mail address. In classless addressing, variable-length blocks 
are assigned that belong to no class. In this architecture, the entire address space (232 addresses) is 
divided into blocks of different sizes. 
Classful addressing is based on the default Class A, B, or C networks. All devices in the same routing 
domain must use the same subnet mask.

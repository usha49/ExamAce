If the graph supports

Soring
5
m>n, then at least one of the node is visited twice or more times in the path. It means, we can
discard the cycling path from the node to the same node. The removal process is repeated until
no node is repeated in the path. This ensures that the paths that exist in the graph be less than or
equal to n.

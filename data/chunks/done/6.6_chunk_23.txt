Often it is necessary to reflect an object thru a plane other than one of these.Which is obtained  with the help 
of a series of transformations (composition). 
  
i. 
translate a known point P that lies in the reflection plane to the origin of the coordinate system 
ii. 
rotate the normal vector to the reflection plane at the origin until it is coincident with the z axis  
                   this makes the reflection plane the z = 0 coordinate plane

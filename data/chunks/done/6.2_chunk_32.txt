Definition of PDA: 
A pushdown automata is a system  which is mathematically defined by sixtuple 
M= (K, ∑, Г ,∆ , S , F) 
where ,  
K: Finite set of states 
∑: is an alphabets (input symbols) 
Г : stack symbols 
S ∈ K ,initial state 
F K :set of final states 
∆ : transition relation is a finite subset of Kx(∑  {e} x Г * ) x (K x Г *) 
i.e  
Kx (∑  {e} x Г * )   (Kx Г *) 
Transition :  
if (p, a, β) , (q , γ)  ∈ ∆ , then  M whenever it is in state p with ' β ' at the top of stack may read ' γ' 
from the input tape ,replace ' β'  by  ' γ'  on the top of the stack and enter state q.

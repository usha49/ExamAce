The physical layer is responsible for several key tasks, including bit representation, data encoding, data 
transmission, synchronization, transmission rates, physical topology, and physical addressing. Bit 
representation defines how data is converted into electrical or optical signals. Different encoding 
techniques such as Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ), Manchester encoding, and Differential Manchester 
encoding are used to represent binary data.

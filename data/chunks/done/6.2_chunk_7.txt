Formal Definition 
A Context free grammar G is quadruple (V, ∑, R, S) , where  
 V is an alphabet  (finite set of variables) 
 ∑ the set of terminals (is a subset of V) 
 R the set of rules (is finite subset of V-∑ x V*) 
 S the start symbol (is an element of V- ∑) 
Here the member of V - ∑ is called non terminals 
 
Derivation of string from CFG 
A derivation of a string w in a given grammar G is a sequence of substitutions starting with the 
start symbol and resulting in w.

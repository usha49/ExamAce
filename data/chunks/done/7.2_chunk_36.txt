This algorithm finds the location 'Loc' of
'item' in array 'a’ or return fail(sets loc=NULL).[Initialize segment variables] set beg = LB, end
= UB and mid = int((beg + end)/2) Repeat steps 3 and 4 while beg<=end and a[mid]!=item if
item<a[mid],then set end=mid – 1 Else set beg=mid + 1 [End if] set mid=int((beg + end)/2)
if a[mid]=item then set loc=mid
print the value and its position else
set loc=NULL
print search unsuccessful
[End if]

Sequential search efficiency:The number of comparisons of keys done in sequential search of
a list of length n is Unsuccessful search: n comparisons ,Successful search, best case: 1
comparison ,Successful search, worst case: n comparisons , Successful search, average case: (n
+ 1)/2 comparisons,In any case, the number of comparison is O(n)

This bias voltage is 
typically set using a combination of diodes, resistors, and thermistors to 

maintain temperature stability. Improper biasing can lead to thermal runaway, 
distortion, or inefficiency, underscoring the importance of careful design and 
implementation.
Power BJTs 
Power bipolar junction transistors are designed to handle high currents and 
voltages, making them essential for power amplifiers and switching applications.

When a packet is received, the routers send it to 
all the interfaces except the one on which it was received. This creates too much burden on the network 
and lots of duplicate packets wandering in the network. Time to Live (TTL) can be used to avoid infinite 
looping of packets. There exists another approach for flooding, which is called Selective Flooding to 
reduce the overhead on the network. In this method, the router does not flood out on all the interfaces, 
but selective ones.

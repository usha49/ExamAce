They feature high open-loop gain, high input 
impedance, and low output impedance, making them ideal for signal amplification 
and processing. Op-amps can be configured in various ways, such as inverting and 
non-inverting amplifiers, integrators, differentiators, and voltage followers. 
They are integral to analog computing, active filters, oscillators, and 
instrumentation.

NFA can always be converted into an equivalent deterministic one.  
Formally, we say that the  two finite automata M1 and M2  (NFA and DFA) are equivalent if and 
only if L(M1) = L(M2). Thus two automata are considered to be equivalent if they accept  the 
same language, even though they may use different methods to do so. 
 
Theorem : For each NFA , there is equivalent DFA.  
Proof: 
Let M=(K, ∑,∆, s, F) be a NFA we shall construct a DFA M'=(K' , ∑, δ', s', F') equivalent to M.

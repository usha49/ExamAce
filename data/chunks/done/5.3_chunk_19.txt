The shortest path algorithm is a technique that uses various algorithms to decide a path with a 
minimum number of hops. Common shortest path algorithms are Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellman Ford 
algorithm. The shortest path algorithm finds the shortest paths between routers/nodes in a graph. The 
widely used shortest path algorithm is Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

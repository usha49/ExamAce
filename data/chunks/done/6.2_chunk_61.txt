Let G1=(V1, ∑1,  R1,S1)  and G2=(V2, ∑2,  R2,S2 ) be two context-free grammars, and without loss 
of generality assume that they have disjoint sets of non-terminals , that is, V1, -  ∑1   and V2 - ∑2   
are disjoint. 
 
Union:  
Let S be a new symbol and let  G= =(V, ∑,  R, S)   where  
V= V1    V2  S 
∑= ∑1   ∑2

In a balanced three-phase 
system, the sum of instantaneous voltages or currents is always zero, 
eliminating the need for a neutral conductor in transmission. Three-phase 
systems can be connected in either a star (Y) or delta (Î”) configuration, each 
with distinct characteristics and applications. The star connection allows for 
the provision of a neutral point, making it suitable for systems requiring 
multiple voltage levels.

The von Neumann architecture forms the basis of most modern computing systems, integrating 
program instructions and data in the same memory space. The CPU fetches instructions from memory, 
decodes them, and executes them in sequence. Harvard architecture, in contrast, separates program 
instructions and data into different memory units, improving processing speed by enabling simultaneous 
access to both instruction and data memory.

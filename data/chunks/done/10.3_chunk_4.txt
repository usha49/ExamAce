The program evaluation and review technique (PERT) is used for projects with
uncertain task durations, employing probabilistic time estimates to improve scheduling
accuracy.
Resource leveling and resource smoothing are techniques used to optimize resource allocation.
Resource leveling ensures that resource demand does not exceed availability, while resource
smoothing adjusts task distribution to maintain a consistent workload.

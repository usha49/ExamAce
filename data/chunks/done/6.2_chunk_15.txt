Thus the same string may have several derivations in a context-free grammar; 
 
Leftmost derivation 
In leftmost derivation, when a step of a derivation can be a part of a leftmost derivation: the 
leftmost non-terminal must be replaced. Derivation of a string w in a grammar G is a leftmost 
derivation if at every step the leftmost remaining variable is the one replaced.

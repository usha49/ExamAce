Interrupts improve system performance by eliminating the need for 
continuous polling, where the processor repeatedly checks device status, thereby wasting processing 
power. 
Interrupts can be classified into two main types: hardware interrupts and software interrupts. Hardware 
interrupts are triggered by external devices such as keyboards, timers, and communication ports. The 
8085 microprocessor has five hardware interrupts: TRAP, RST 7.5, RST 6.5, RST 5.5, and INTR.

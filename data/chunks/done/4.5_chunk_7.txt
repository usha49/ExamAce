Threads are categorized into:
User-Level Threads: Managed by user-level libraries without kernel intervention.
Kernel-Level Threads: Managed directly by the OS kernel, offering better 
integration but higher overhead.
Threads improve performance by enabling multitasking within a single process, 
such as updating a GUI while processing background tasks.
Multiprocessing
Multiprocessing involves the use of two or more CPUs (or cores) in a single 
computer system to execute processes simultaneously.

A 4-to-1
multiplexer has four inputs, one output, and two control lines that determine which input is
selected. Multiplexers are used in communication systems and data transmission. A
demultiplexer performs the opposite function by taking a single input and directing it to one of
multiple outputs based on control signals, commonly used in digital displays and signal routing.
A decoder converts binary input into a unique active output line.

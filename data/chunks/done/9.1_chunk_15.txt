PEAS
stands for:
P
Performance Measure
E
Environment
A
Actuators
S
Sensors
Each of these components defines a crucial aspect of an agentâ€™s
functionality.
The performance measure defines the criteria by which the success of
an agent is evaluated.
It answers the question: What is considered a good outcome for the
agent?

The performance measure should be well-defined, reflecting the
desired outcomes rather than the internal process of the agent.
It is not about how the agent achieves the goal but about how well
the goal is achieved.
Examples of Performance Measure:
Agent Performance Measure
Autonomous Car
Safety, travel time, passenger comfort, fuel
efficiency.
Vacuum Cleaner Robot
Cleanliness, battery efficiency, coverage.
Search Engine
Relevance of search results, user satisfaction.
Medical Diagnosis System
Accuracy of diagnosis, speed, patient
recovery rate.
Key Considerations for Performance Measure:
Completeness: It should consider all relevant aspects (e.g., a car
shouldn't drive fast but dangerously).
Balance: Avoid over-optimizing one criterion (e.g., a vacuum robot
cleaning the same spot repeatedly to ensure it is "clean").
Trade-offs: Often involves balancing multiple goals (e.g., speed vs.
safety).

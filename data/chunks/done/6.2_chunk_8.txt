If u, v, and w are strings of variables and terminals, and A  w is a rule of the grammar, we say 
that uAv yields uwv, written uAv   uwv. Say that u derives v, written u * v, if u v  or if a 
sequence ul, u2, . ., uk exists for k ≥ 0 and   
u  u1 u2  .. …….  uk  v. 
 
e.g. 
A0A1 
A  B 
B# 
 
A 0A100A11  000A111  000B111  000#111 is a derivation of the string 000#111 in 
the grammar defined above.  
The symbol "" reads "yields".

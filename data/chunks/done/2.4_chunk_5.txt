The central processing unit (CPU) 
is the core of the microprocessor, responsible for executing instructions and performing arithmetic and 
logic operations. The CPU contains an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) that performs mathematical 
calculations, a control unit that manages data flow, and a register array that temporarily stores data. 
Memory is used to store both program instructions and data.

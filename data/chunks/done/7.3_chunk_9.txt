The First Normal Form (1NF) ensures that all attributes contain atomic values,
eliminating repeating groups. The Second Normal Form (2NF) eliminates partial dependencies
by ensuring that non-key attributes depend entirely on the primary key. The Third Normal Form
(3NF) removes transitive dependencies, ensuring that non-key attributes depend only on the
primary key.

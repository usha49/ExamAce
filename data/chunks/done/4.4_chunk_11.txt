Programmers 
interact with hardware via drivers and APIs, simplifying complex hardware tasks.
Development Environment
The development of embedded systems involves specialized tools and workflows:
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Combine code editors, compilers, and 
debugging tools. Examples include Keil ÂµVision, MPLAB, and Arduino IDE.
Simulators and Emulators: Allow testing and debugging without requiring physical 
hardware.

Nortonâ€™s equivalent circuit is particularly 
useful in systems where parallel configurations dominate, as it simplifies the 
study of how current divides among parallel branches.
Maximum power transfer theorem
The maximum power transfer theorem focuses on the conditions under which a load 
receives maximum power from a network.

Rotation about an arbitrary  axis  : 
An arbitrary axis in space passing thru point (x0, y0, z0) with direction cosines (cx, cy, cz) 
Steps required for rotation about this axis by some angle 0 are: 
  i.  Translate so that point(x0, y0, z0) is at the origin of the coordinate system 
  ii. Perform  rotations to make axis of rotation coincident with the z axis 
  iii.Rotate about the z axis by the angle Î¸. 
  iv.Perform the inverse of the combined rotation transformation

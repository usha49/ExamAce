Move up left,
skipping over elements that are larger than the pivot; When down and up have stopped, down
is pointing at a large element and up is pointing at a small element; If down is left of up, swap
the elements at down and up (The effect is to push a large element to the right and a small
element to the left);Swap the first element (pivot) with the element at up.

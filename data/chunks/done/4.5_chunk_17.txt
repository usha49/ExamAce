The system adjusts its input based on the error signal 
(difference between reference and actual output) to achieve the desired 
performance.
Characteristics of Close-Loop Control Systems
Feedback: Continuous monitoring of output to ensure accuracy.
Higher Accuracy: Able to adapt to disturbances and maintain performance.
Complex Design: Requires additional components like sensors and controllers.
Stability Challenges: Feedback loops must be carefully designed to avoid 
instability.
Examples
A thermostat adjusts the heating or cooling based on the difference between the 
room temperature and the desired setpoint.
Cruise control in cars maintains a set speed by adjusting throttle input based 
on road conditions.
Mathematical Representation
Close-loop systems are represented as: T(s)= G(s)/(1+G(s)H(s)) Where:
T(s) is the overall transfer function.
G(s) is the plant's transfer function.
H(s) is the feedback path's transfer function.
Components of a Close-Loop System
Sensor: Measures the output and sends feedback.
Controller: Computes the error and determines corrective actions.
Actuator: Implements the controller's output to adjust the system.
Plant: The system being controlled.
Control:
Control engineering focuses on designing systems to achieve desired outputs by 

manipulating inputs based on feedback or predefined rules.

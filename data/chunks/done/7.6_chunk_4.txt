Fragmentation is classified into
internal fragmentation, where allocated memory has unused space, and external fragmentation,
where free memory exists but is not contiguous. Techniques such as compaction, paging, and
segmentation help reduce fragmentation and optimize memory usage.
Virtual memory management extends the systemâ€™s usable memory beyond the physical RAM by
using secondary storage (such as a hard disk) as an extension of memory.

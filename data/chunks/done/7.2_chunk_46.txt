This technique is known as linear
probing.Disadvantages of linear probing: One main disadvantage of linear probing is that,
records tend to cluster, that is, the records appear next to one another when the table is about
half full.
Clustering occurs when a hash function is biased towards the placement of keys into a given
region within the storage space.

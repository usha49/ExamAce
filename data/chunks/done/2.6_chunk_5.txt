It 
then saves the contents of the program counter (PC) and status registers to preserve the execution 
state. The processor then transfers control to the corresponding interrupt service routine (ISR), which is 
a predefined set of instructions that handle the interrupt request. After executing the ISR, the processor 
restores the previously saved register values and resumes execution of the interrupted program. 
Interrupt handling can be implemented using vectored and non-vectored interrupts.

On the other hand, 
a problem is called “hard”, if it cannot be solved efficiently, or if we don’t know whether it can 
be solved efficiently. Examples of “hard” problems are (i) time table scheduling for all courses at 
Carleton, (ii) factoring a 300-digit integer into its prime factors, and (iii) computing a layout for 
chips in VLSI. 
Central Question in Complexity Theory: Classify problems according to their degree of 
“difficulty”.

Finite automata are good models of 
computers with a extremely limited amount of memory. Example of finite automata is Elevator 
problem, control unit of computer etc. 
 
Fig: Finite automata 
An automaton has a mechanism to read input ,which is string over a given alphabet. This input is 
actually written on an input tape /file  ,which can be read by automaton but cannot change it.  
Input file is divided into cells each of which can hold one symbol.

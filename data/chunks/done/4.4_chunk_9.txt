This architecture is often embedded on a single chip (System-on-Chip or SoC) to 
minimize size and power consumption.
Operation and Programmer’s View
From the programmer’s perspective, embedded systems operate at two levels:
Low-Level Operation: Involves direct manipulation of hardware registers and 
peripherals, typically through assembly language or C.

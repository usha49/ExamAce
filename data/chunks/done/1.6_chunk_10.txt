Class AB amplifiers are ubiquitous in 
audio power amplification, offering an excellent compromise between fidelity and 
efficiency.
Biasing the Class AB Stage
The Class AB stage requires precise biasing to achieve optimal performance. The 
bias voltage ensures that the transistors remain slightly conductive during the 
zero-crossing of the input signal, preventing distortion.

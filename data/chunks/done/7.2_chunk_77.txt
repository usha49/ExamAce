Generally, heap sort is used
for large amount of data.
Heap as Priority Queue:A priority queue is a data structure with the following
primitive operations:Insert an item;Remove the item having the largest (or smallest)
key.Implementations:Use a sorted contiguous list, removal takes O(1) but insertion takes
O(n);Use an unsorted list, insertion takes O(1) but removal takes O(n) Efficiency
Priority Queue:Consider the properties of heap:The item with largest key is on the top
and can be removed immediately.

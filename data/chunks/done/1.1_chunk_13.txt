Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), on 
the other hand, asserts that the total current entering a junction equals the 
total current leaving it. These laws are cornerstones of circuit theory, 
enabling engineers to analyze and design complex electrical networks 
systematically.
 linear and non-linear circuit
Circuits can be classified based on the relationship between voltage and 
current. In linear circuits, this relationship is directly proportional, making 
them predictable and easy to analyze.

Example 2 
Design a CFG for the language consists of all strings over the alphabet {(,), +, *, id} that 
represent syntactically correct arithmetic expressions involving + and *. id stands for any 
identifier, that is to say, variable name .Examples of such strings are id and id * (id * id + id), but 
not *id + ( or + * id.

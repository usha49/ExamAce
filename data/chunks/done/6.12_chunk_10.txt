Thus if (q, w) and (q', w') are two configurations of M, 
then (q, w) 
 (q', w') if and only if w = aw' for some symbol a є ∑, and δ(q, a) = q'. For every 
configuration except those of the from (q, e) there is a uniquely determined next configuration. 
A configuration of the form (q, e) signifies that M has consumed all its input, and hence its operation 
ceases at this point.

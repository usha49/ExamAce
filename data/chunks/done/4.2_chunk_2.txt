Logical operations, including AND, OR, XOR, and NOT, are used for 
bitwise manipulation and decision-making processes. These operations are 
critical for implementing algorithms, performing data transformations, and 
supporting complex problem-solving in various applications. The CPU uses 
algorithms such as Boothâ€™s algorithm for efficient multiplication and the non-
restoring division method for division.

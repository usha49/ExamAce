If transformation parameters are not all equal then figure gets distorted 
 
So we can preserve the original shape of an object with uniform scaling(sx= sy= sz) 
 
Matrix expression for scaling transformation of a position P = (x,y,z) relative to the coordinate origin can be 
written as : 
  
      x’              sx     0      0     0              x 
      y’              0      sy     0     0       .

Optimized processors are often implemented 
using hardware description languages (HDLs) like VHDL or Verilog and synthesized 
into ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits).
Basic Architecture
The architecture of embedded systems varies based on the application but 

generally includes:
Processor: Microcontroller, microprocessor, or custom-designed processor.
Memory: Includes ROM for firmware storage and RAM for temporary data.
Input/Output Interfaces: Enable communication with external devices like sensors 
and actuators.
Timers and Counters: Support real-time operations and synchronization.
Communication Interfaces: Protocols like UART, SPI, and I2C for data exchange.

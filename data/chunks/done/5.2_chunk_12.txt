Stop-and-Wait ARQ sends a frame and waits for 
an acknowledgment before transmitting the next frame. If no acknowledgment is received in time, the 
sender retransmits the frame. Piggybacking is used in bidirectional communication, where 
acknowledgements are placed in data frame headers to save bandwidth. Go-Back-N ARQ allows the 
sender to send multiple frames without receiving acknowledgments for each. If a frame is lost, all 
subsequent frames are retransmitted.

The Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) is a stricter version of 3NF, ensuring that
every determinant is a candidate key.
Functional dependencies define the relationship between attributes in a relation. If an attribute X
uniquely determines another attribute Y, then Y is functionally dependent on X. Functional
dependencies help in the normalization process by identifying redundant data and eliminating
anomalies.

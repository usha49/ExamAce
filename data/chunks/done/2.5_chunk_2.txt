It is used for temporary storage of 
data that the processor actively uses during program execution. RAM is further divided into Static RAM 
(SRAM) and Dynamic RAM (DRAM). SRAM uses flip-flops to store data, making it faster and more 
expensive, while DRAM uses capacitors, which require constant refreshing but provide higher storage 
density. ROM is a non-volatile memory that stores permanent instructions such as the system firmware 
or BIOS.

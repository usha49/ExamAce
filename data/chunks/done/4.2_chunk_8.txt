Temporal locality 
suggests that recently accessed data is likely to be accessed again soon, while 
spatial locality indicates that data located near recently accessed addresses is 
also likely to be accessed. Cache memory reduces the latency of data retrieval 
by serving as an intermediate storage layer between the CPU and main memory.
Elements of Cache design:
Cache size
The size of the cache determines how much data it can hold.

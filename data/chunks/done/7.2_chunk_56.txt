Also, all the elements in positions greater than or equal to N-i
are already in proper position after pass i, so they need not be considered in succeeding passes.
Procedure: void bubblesort(int a[], int N)
{

Soring
11
int pass, j; for(pass=0; pass<N-1;
pass++)
{
for(j=0; j<N-pass-1; j++)
if(a[j]>a[j+1] swap(&a[j],
&a[j+1]);
}}
Algorithm:Given a list A of size N, the following algorithm uses bubble sort to sort the list
–
For pass = 0 To N – 2
•
For j = 0 To N – pass – 2
–
If A[j] > A[j + 1]
Swap the elements A[j] and A[j + 1]
End If
•
End For
–
End For
Efficiency:This algorithm is good for small n usually less than 100 elements.No.

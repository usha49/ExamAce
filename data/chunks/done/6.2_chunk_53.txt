These two methods are equivalent, in the sense that a language L has a PDA that accepts it by 
final state if and only if L has a PDA that accepts it by empty stack. 
However for a given PDA P, the languages that P accepts by final state and by empty stack are 
usually different. We will show conversion of a PDA accepting L by final state into another PDA 
that accepts L by empty stack, and vice-versa. 
Acceptance by Final State 
 
Let M = (K,, δ, s, Г,  F) be a PDA.

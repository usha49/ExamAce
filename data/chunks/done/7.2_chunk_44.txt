We defined the hash function in this case as Hash (key) = p;
Where p is obtained by deleting digits from both ends of (key)2. We emphasize that the same
positions of (key)2 must be used for all the keys.Division Remainder method
Convert the key to an integer, divide by the size of the index range and take the remainder as the
result.Collision Resolution Techniques: When a collision occurs, alternative locations in the
table are tried until an empty location is found.

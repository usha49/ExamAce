Routers support different WAN technologies but switches do not. Wireless Routers 
have Access Points built in. The most common home use for routers is to share a broadband internet 
connection. The router has a public IP address, and that address is shared with the network. When data 
comes through the router, it is forwarded to the correct computer. 
Gateways are also routers, which forward the traffic of a subnetwork to other networks or to the 
internet.

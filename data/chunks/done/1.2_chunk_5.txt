This equivalent circuit simplifies the analysis, especially when 
studying the effect of different load resistances on the circuit.
 Norton`s theorem
Nortonâ€™s theorem offers an alternative way to simplify electrical networks. It 
states that a linear electrical network can be reduced to an equivalent circuit 
consisting of a single current source in parallel with a resistance.

The DMA controller takes 
over the bus, performs the transfer, and notifies the CPU upon completion via an 
interrupt.
Key steps in DMA operation:
The CPU initializes the DMA controller with the memory address, data size, and 
device information.
The DMA controller requests bus access from the CPU.
Upon gaining control of the bus, the controller transfers data directly between 
the memory and the device.
Once the transfer is complete, the controller generates an interrupt to inform 
the CPU.
The DMA transfer rate is higher than that of programmed or interrupt-driven I/O, 
making it ideal for high-speed peripherals like disk drives and network 

adapters.
Characteristics of multiprocessors
Multiprocessors consist of two or more CPUs working together to execute tasks.

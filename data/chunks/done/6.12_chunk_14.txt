Solution 
Let required DFA M= (K,∑, δ, s, F)  
where 
K= {q0,  q1 , q2,  q3 } 
∑= { a ,b} 
s=q0 
F= {   q0, q1, q2  } and δ is the function tabulated below

State q3 is said to be a dead state, and if M reaches state q3 it is said to be trapped, since no further input 
can enable it to escape from this state.

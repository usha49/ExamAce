Techniques 
include:
Locks: Ensure only one processor accesses a critical section at a time.
Barriers: Processors wait until all others reach a certain point before 
proceeding.
Atomic Operations: Hardware-supported operations that execute without 
interruption, such as test-and-set or compare-and-swap.
Formulas used in synchronization include:

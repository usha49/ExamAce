Trees are widely used in
database indexing, file systems, artificial intelligence, and hierarchical data representation.
A binary tree is a type of tree where each node has at most two children. Operations in a binary
tree include insertion, deletion, and searching. Insertion involves adding a new node while
maintaining the tree structure. Searching is performed to find whether a specific element exists
within the tree.

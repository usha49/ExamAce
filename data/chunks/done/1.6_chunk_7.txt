Despite its inefficiency, the Class A output stage is valued for its high 
fidelity and is commonly used in audio amplifiers and small-signal applications 
requiring minimal distortion.
Class B Output Stage
The Class B output stage addresses the inefficiency of Class A by utilizing two 
complementary transistors in a push-pull configuration. Each transistor handles 
one-half of the input waveform, effectively halving the power dissipation 
compared to Class A.

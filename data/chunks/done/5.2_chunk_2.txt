At the receiving end, the data link layer picks up 
data from the hardware, which is in the form of electrical signals, assembles them into a recognizable 
frame format, and hands them over to the upper layer. To detect errors efficiently and easily, 
transmitting a small-size data is a better approach. 
The data link layer has two sub-layers: Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC). The 
LLC deals with protocols, flow-control, and error control.

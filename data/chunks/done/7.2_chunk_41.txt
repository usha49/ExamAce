Hash Function: The basic idea in hashing is
the transformation of a key into the corresponding location in the hash table. This is done by a
hash function. A hash function can be defined as a function that takes key as input and
transforms it into a hash table index usually denoted by H. Some popular hash functions are
Folding, Mid square method,Division method. Hash of Key Let H be a hash function and k is a
key then H(k) is called hash-of-key.

Oscillators are widely used in communication systems, signal processing, and 
timing circuits.
Basic Principles of RC Oscillators
RC oscillators generate sinusoidal waveforms using resistors and capacitors in 
their feedback network. These oscillators operate at low to moderate frequencies 
and are known for their simplicity and stability. The frequency of oscillation 
is determined by the RC time constant, which defines how quickly the circuit 
charges and discharges.

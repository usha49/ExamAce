The AND gate outputs a high signal only if all inputs are high, whereas the OR gate
outputs high if at least one input is high. The NOT gate, also known as an inverter, reverses the
input signal, outputting high when the input is low and vice versa. NAND and NOR gates are
universal, meaning they can be used to construct any other logic gate. The NAND gate gives a
low output only when all inputs are high, whereas the NOR gate outputs high only when all
inputs are low.

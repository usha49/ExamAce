Solution 
Let G = (V,∑, R, E) where V, ∑, and R are as follows. 
V = {+,*, ( , ) , id, T,F , E}, 
∑= {+, *, (, ), id}, 
 
R = { 
         E  E +T,  
 
 
(R1) 
         E T,  
 
 
(R2) 
        TT*F,  
 
 
(R3) 
        TF, 
 
 
 
(R4) 
        F  (E),  
 
 
(R5) 
        F  id }.  
 
 
(R6) 
The symbols  E, T, and F are abbreviations for expression, term, and factor, respectively. 
The grammar G generates the string (id * id + id) * (id + id) by the following derivation.

The agent searches for
a sequence of actions that leads to the goal.
Key Characteristics:
Requires goal formulation (what is the desired outcome?).
Uses search and planning techniques to find a path to the goal.
Can handle more complex environments than reflex agents.
Flexible â€“ Can adapt to new goals by recalculating the best actions.
Utility Based;

Utility-based agents extend goal-based agents by incorporating a
utility function.
While goal-based agents focus only on achieving the goal, utility-
based agents consider the quality of different goal states and the
cost of achieving them.
A utility function assigns a numerical value to each possible state,
indicating the desirability of that state.
The agent chooses the action that maximizes its expected utility.
Key Characteristics:
Evaluates multiple paths to a goal based on utility (cost, risk,
reward).
Considers trade-offs between competing goals.
Handles situations with uncertainty better than goal-based agents.
Allows for optimization (e.g., choosing the fastest, safest, or
cheapest solution).

Web: HTTP & HTTPS 
HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of the World Wide Web. Hypertext is a well-
organized documentation system that uses hyperlinks to link the pages in the text documents. HTTP 
works on a client-server model. When a user wants to access any HTTP page on the internet, the client 
machine at the user end initiates a TCP connection to the server on port 80.

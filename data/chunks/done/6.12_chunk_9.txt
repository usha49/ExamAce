Let M = (K, ∑, δ, s, F) be a DFA ,we say that a word in K x ∑* is a configuration of M. It represents the 
current states of M and remaining unread input of M. e.g (q2,  ababab) is one configuration  
a
b
a
b
a
b
 
current scanning symbol 
 
The binary relation 
 holds between two configurations of M  if and only if the machine can pass 
from one to the other as a result of a single move.

An Efficient method for calculating transitive closure is by Warshall’s algorithm whose
time complexity is only O(n3).Warshall’s Algorithm procedure warshall (MR : n x n zero one
matrix){D = MR
for k = 1 to n
begin for i = 1 to n begin
for j = 1 to n
dij = dij
(dik
dkj)
end
}
D = [dij] is the transitive closure.Topological Sorting:A topological sort is an ordering of
vertices in a directed acyclic (graph with no cycle) graph (dag), such that if there is a path from
vi to vj, then vi appears before vj in the ordering.

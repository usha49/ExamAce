RSA ensures secure communication by making it 
computationally difficult to derive the private key from the public key. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange 
algorithm allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel, enabling 
encrypted communication without prior key sharing. Digital signatures authenticate messages by 
ensuring that data has not been tampered with during transmission.

A topological sort of a graph can be viewed as
an ordering of its vertices along a horizontal line so that all directed edges go from left to
right.Applications:Consider the course available at university as the vertices of a directed
graph; where there is an edge from one course to another if the first is a prerequisite for the
second.A topological ordering is then a listing of all the courses such that all prerequisite for a
course appear before it does.Algorithms to find out topological ordering:Breadth First
Ordering:In Breadth First Topological ordering of a directed graph with no cycles, we start by
finding the vertices that should be first in the topological order and then apply the fact that
every vertex must come before its successors in the topological order.

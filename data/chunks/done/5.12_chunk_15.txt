ISDN architecture consists of multiple channels, 
including the bearer (B) channel for data transmission, the delta (D) channel for signaling and control, 
and hybrid channels that combine both functions. ISDN supports faster data transfer rates than 
traditional analog telephone systems and is used for applications such as video conferencing, remote 
access, and high-speed internet.

Since routers running a classful routing protocol do not include 
subnet mask information with routing updates, the router assumes either its own subnet mask or 
defaults to the classful subnet mask. 
Classless addressing, on the other hand, allows the use of variable-length subnet masks, or Variable-
Length Subnet Masking (VLSM), because subnet mask information is included with routing updates. You 
can have a mixture of different subnet masks in the same routing domain.

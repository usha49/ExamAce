Circuit 
switching establishes a dedicated communication path between sender and receiver for the entire 
duration of the communication session. It is commonly used in traditional telephone networks. Packet 
switching divides data into small packets, which are transmitted independently and reassembled at the 
destination. This method is more efficient than circuit switching and is the basis of modern internet 
communication.

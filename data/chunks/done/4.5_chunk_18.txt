Control systems are 
categorized as:
Continuous-Time Control: Operates on analog signals and is described using 
differential equations.
Discrete-Time Control: Processes sampled signals and uses difference equations.
Types of Control Strategies
Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Control:
PID controllers combine three control actions:
Proportional (P): Produces an output proportional to the error.
Integral (I): Accounts for accumulated error over time.
Derivative (D): Predicts future error based on its rate of change.

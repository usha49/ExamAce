Alternating current fundamentals:
Principle of generation of alternating voltages and currents
The generation of alternating voltage and current is based on the principle of 
electromagnetic induction, discovered by Michael Faraday. When a conductor moves 
through a magnetic field, or when the magnetic field surrounding a stationary 
conductor varies, an electromotive force (EMF) is induced in the conductor. In 
practical systems, this is achieved using rotating machines like alternators. In 
an alternator, a coil of wire rotates in a magnetic field, creating a time-
varying flux linkage. The induced EMF is sinusoidal because the flux linkage 
changes sinusoidally with time as the coil rotates through the magnetic field. 
This sinusoidal nature of EMF is foundational to alternating current systems, as 
it allows for efficient transmission and transformation of electrical energy.
Equations and waveforms of alternating Voltage and current 
Alternating voltage and current vary periodically with time, described 
mathematically by sinusoidal functions. For instance, an alternating voltage can 
be expressed as ( )=

the angular frequency,t is time, and ϕ is the phase angle. The waveform of 
alternating voltage or current is typically represented as a sine wave, which 
alternates between positive and negative values, completing a full cycle in one 
period. These waveforms are fundamental to understanding AC systems, as they 
define how voltage and current behave over time.
Average, Peak and RMS values
In AC systems, the average value, peak value, and root mean square (RMS) value 
are essential metrics for analyzing and describing alternating voltages and 
currents. The peak value is the maximum magnitude of the waveform, representing 
the highest voltage or current attained during a cycle. The average value of a 
sine wave over one complete cycle is zero, but over a half-cycle, it represents 
the mean of the absolute values of the waveform. The RMS value is particularly 
important in AC systems as it provides a measure of the effective or equivalent 
DC value of an alternating quantity. It is calculated as the square root of the 
average of the squares of instantaneous values over one cycle and is widely used 
in practical applications to quantify power.
Three phase system
A three-phase system is a method of generating, transmitting, and distributing 
electrical power using three alternating voltages or currents that are phase-
shifted by 120 degrees from each other. This system is highly efficient and 
widely used in industrial and power applications. In a balanced three-phase 
system, the sum of instantaneous voltages or currents is always zero, 
eliminating the need for a neutral conductor in transmission. Three-phase 
systems can be connected in either a star (Y) or delta (Δ) configuration, each 
with distinct characteristics and applications. The star connection allows for 
the provision of a neutral point, making it suitable for systems requiring 
multiple voltage levels. The delta connection, on the other hand, is often used 
in transmission and distribution due to its higher efficiency in power transfer.

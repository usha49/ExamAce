10.3 Project Planning and Scheduling
Project planning and scheduling are critical components of engineering project management,
ensuring that projects are completed efficiently, within budget, and on time. The classification
of projects is based on various factors, including scope, duration, funding source, and technical
complexity. Projects can be categorized as public or private, infrastructure or technology-based,
and short-term or long-term.
The project life cycle consists of multiple phases, including initiation, where project feasibility
and objectives are defined; planning, where detailed scheduling, budgeting, and resource
allocation take place; execution, where actual work is carried out and project deliverables are
produced; monitoring and control, where progress is tracked and necessary adjustments are
made; and closure, where final evaluations and documentation are completed.
Project scheduling involves organizing tasks and activities in a structured manner to ensure
efficient progress. The bar chart, commonly known as the Gantt chart, visually represents
project timelines and dependencies. The critical path method (CPM) identifies the longest
sequence of dependent tasks, helping project managers determine activities that cannot be
delayed. The program evaluation and review technique (PERT) is used for projects with
uncertain task durations, employing probabilistic time estimates to improve scheduling
accuracy.
Resource leveling and resource smoothing are techniques used to optimize resource allocation.
Resource leveling ensures that resource demand does not exceed availability, while resource
smoothing adjusts task distribution to maintain a consistent workload. Monitoring, evaluation,
and control are essential for tracking project performance, identifying deviations, and
implementing corrective actions.

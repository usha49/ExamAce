1.2 Network theorems:
Concept of superposition theorem
The concept of superposition theorem is foundational in the analysis of linear 
electrical circuits. This theorem is used to calculate the total response in a 
circuit containing multiple independent sources by considering the effect of 
each source separately. In this process, all other sources are replaced with 
their internal impedances. For instance, voltage sources are replaced with short 
circuits, while current sources are replaced with open circuits. After 
determining the contributions of each source individually, the total response is 
obtained by summing these contributions algebraically. Superposition is 
particularly beneficial in simplifying the analysis of circuits with multiple 
power sources, making it easier to determine voltage, current, or power at any 
point in the circuit. This theorem is limited to linear systems where the 
principle of superposition applies.
 Thevenin`s theorem
Thevenin's theorem is another powerful tool used in circuit analysis, 
particularly for simplifying complex networks. According to this theorem, any 
linear electrical network with voltage sources and resistances can be 
represented as an equivalent circuit with a single voltage source in series with 
a resistance. To apply Thevenin's theorem, the portion of the circuit of 
interest is first isolated by removing the load resistance. The open-circuit 
voltage, also known as the Thevenin voltage, is then determined across the 
terminals where the load was connected. The equivalent resistance is found by 
deactivating all independent sources and calculating the resistance seen from 
the terminals. This equivalent circuit simplifies the analysis, especially when 
studying the effect of different load resistances on the circuit.
 Norton`s theorem
Norton’s theorem offers an alternative way to simplify electrical networks. It 
states that a linear electrical network can be reduced to an equivalent circuit 
consisting of a single current source in parallel with a resistance. To derive 
the Norton equivalent, the short-circuit current is calculated across the 
terminals of interest, while the equivalent resistance is found in the same 
manner as in Thevenin's theorem. Norton’s equivalent circuit is particularly 
useful in systems where parallel configurations dominate, as it simplifies the 
study of how current divides among parallel branches.
Maximum power transfer theorem
The maximum power transfer theorem focuses on the conditions under which a load 
receives maximum power from a network. According to this theorem, maximum power 
is delivered to the load when the load resistance equals the internal resistance 
of the source or the Thevenin equivalent resistance. This principle is widely 
applied in electrical and electronic engineering, particularly in designing 
systems like audio amplifiers and communication circuits. The trade-off between 
efficiency and maximum power is an important consideration, as achieving maximum 
power does not necessarily imply maximum efficiency.
 R-L, R-C, R-L-C circuits
Circuits containing combinations of resistors, inductors, and capacitors, such 
as R-L, R-C, and R-L-C circuits, exhibit unique characteristics depending on 
their configurations and the type of current applied. R-L circuits consist of a 
resistor and inductor in series or parallel. The current in these circuits lags 
the voltage due to the inductive reactance, which increases with frequency. In 
R-C circuits, comprising resistors and capacitors, the current leads the voltage 
due to capacitive reactance, which decreases with frequency. R-L-C circuits 
combine resistors, inductors, and capacitors, and their behavior is determined 

by the resonance condition. These circuits are fundamental in the design of 
filters, oscillators, and tuning circuits in communication systems.
resonance in AC series and parallel circuit
Resonance in AC circuits occurs when the inductive reactance and capacitive 
reactance become equal, resulting in a purely resistive impedance at a specific 
frequency known as the resonant frequency. In series resonance, the total 
impedance of the circuit is minimized, and the current is maximized, making it 
useful in applications such as tuning radio frequencies. In contrast, parallel 
resonance occurs when the circuit impedance is maximized, and the current is 
minimized, which is often used in power systems to limit unwanted currents. 
Resonance phenomena are critical in the design and analysis of AC circuits for 
achieving desired frequency responses.
 
active and reactive power
In AC circuits, the concept of power is divided into active and reactive power. 
Active power, measured in watts, represents the real power consumed by resistive 
elements to perform useful work. Reactive power, measured in volt-amperes 
reactive (VAR), represents the power that oscillates between the source and 
reactive components, such as inductors and capacitors, without being dissipated. 
The combination of these powers forms the apparent power, which is represented 
as a vector sum in the power triangle. Understanding the interplay between 
active and reactive power is crucial in power system design and operation, as it 
affects the efficiency and stability of electrical systems.

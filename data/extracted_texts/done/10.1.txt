10.1 Engineering Drawings and Its Concepts
Engineering drawing is an essential tool in the field of engineering, serving as a precise
graphical representation of objects, structures, and systems. It plays a crucial role in
communicating technical details among engineers, designers, manufacturers, and builders,
ensuring that the intended design is accurately understood and implemented. The fundamentals
of standard drawing sheets include various standardized paper sizes such as A0, A1, A2, A3,
and A4, defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). These drawing
sheets contain essential elements such as title blocks, borders, and revision tables, which
provide crucial information about the drawing, including the project title, scale, date, and
approval signatures. Proper organization of a drawing sheet ensures clarity and consistency in
technical documentation.
Dimensions in engineering drawings represent the measurable attributes of an object, including
lengths, widths, diameters, and angles. Proper dimensioning follows international standards like
ISO 129 and ASME Y14.5, ensuring uniformity across different engineering fields. It includes
various types such as linear dimensions, which define straight-line distances; angular
dimensions, which measure angles between intersecting lines; and radial dimensions, which
describe circular features. The use of tolerances, including limit dimensions and fits, ensures
that manufactured parts meet the required specifications with acceptable deviations.
Scale is another fundamental aspect of engineering drawings, as real-world objects often need
to be represented at a proportionate size. Engineers use different types of scales, including full
scale (1:1), where the drawing size is the same as the actual size, enlarged scales (e.g., 2:1 or
10:1) for small components, and reduced scales (e.g., 1:10 or 1:100) for large structures like
buildings or mechanical assemblies. Using the appropriate scale is crucial in making drawings
readable and practical for manufacturing and construction.
Line diagrams are simplified graphical representations of systems, commonly used in electrical,
mechanical, and plumbing engineering. These diagrams use standardized symbols to represent
components and their connections, making complex systems easier to understand.
Orthographic projection is a method of visually representing three-dimensional objects using
multiple two-dimensional views. It follows parallel projection principles, showing different
aspects of an object such as front, top, and side views. This method is essential in technical
drawings, as it provides accurate measurements and eliminates perspective distortion.

Isometric projection or isometric view is a technique used to illustrate a three-dimensional
object in a way that all three axes appear equally inclined at 120 degrees to each other. This
projection helps engineers and designers visualize objects more effectively, particularly in
mechanical and architectural drawings. Pictorial views, including perspective and oblique
projections, are used to present objects in a way that closely resembles how they appear to the
human eye. These views are commonly used in presentations and design concepts to provide a
more realistic representation of an object.
Sectional drawings are used to reveal the internal features of an object by cutting through it and
displaying a cross-sectional view. This technique helps engineers understand the internal
structure and hidden components of complex assemblies. Sectional drawings can be classified
into different types, including full sections, which cut through the entire object; half sections,
which show only half of the internal view while keeping the other half intact; and offset sections,
which follow a non-linear cutting plane to reveal important internal details.

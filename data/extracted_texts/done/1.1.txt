1. Concept of Basic Electrical and Electronics Engineering     
1.1 Basic concept: 
Ohm´s law
Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering that explains the 
relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electric circuit. 
According to this law, the current passing through a conductor is directly 
proportional to the voltage across its ends and inversely proportional to the 
resistance offered by the conductor. This relationship remains valid as long as 
the physical conditions, such as temperature, remain constant. This law is 
instrumental in understanding and designing electrical circuits, as it provides 
a basis for calculating any one of the three variables if the other two are 
known. The unit of resistance, the ohm, is named after Georg Simon Ohm, who 
formulated this principle. Understanding Ohm's Law is crucial for analyzing both 
simple circuits, like a single resistor connected to a voltage source, and 
complex systems involving networks of components. 
electric voltage and current
Voltage and current are two fundamental concepts in electrical circuits. 
Voltage, often referred to as potential difference, is the measure of the 
electric potential energy per unit charge between two points in a circuit. It is 
the driving force that causes electrons to move through a conductor, creating an 
electric current. Current, on the other hand, is the flow of electric charge 
through a conductor, measured in terms of the amount of charge passing through a 
point per unit time. Voltage is analogous to the pressure in a water pipe that 
pushes water, while current is similar to the flow of water. Together, these 
concepts form the backbone of circuit analysis, helping engineers understand and 
predict the behavior of electrical systems.
power and energy
Electric power represents the rate at which electrical energy is converted into 
another form of energy, such as heat, light, or motion. It is a critical concept 
in understanding the efficiency and functionality of electrical devices. Power 
depends on both the voltage supplied and the current flowing through a device. 
Electrical energy, on the other hand, is the total amount of work done or energy 
transferred by an electrical circuit over a period. It is commonly measured in 
watt-hours (Wh) or joules (J). These concepts are fundamental in designing 
electrical systems and ensuring their optimal performance in various 
applications, from household appliances to industrial machines.
conducting and insulating materials
Materials are classified as conductors or insulators based on their ability to 
allow the flow of electric current. Conductors, such as copper and silver, have 
a high density of free electrons that can move freely under the influence of an 
electric field, making them ideal for electrical wiring and connections. 
Insulators, such as rubber and glass, lack free electrons and resist the flow of 
electric current. They are essential for ensuring safety and preventing unwanted 
current flow in electrical systems. Understanding these materials is vital for 
selecting the appropriate components in electrical and electronic design.
Series and parallel electric circuits
In a series circuit, components are connected end-to-end in a single path, so 
the same current flows through each component. However, the voltage across each 
component varies depending on its resistance. Series circuits are commonly used 
in applications where a consistent current is required. Parallel circuits, by 
contrast, involve components connected across the same voltage source. Each 
component receives the same voltage, but the total current is the sum of the 

currents through individual components. Parallel circuits are widely used in 
household wiring to ensure each appliance operates independently. These two 
configurations form the basis for analyzing and designing complex electrical 
networks.
star-delta and delta-star conversion
Star and delta configurations are methods of connecting components in three-
phase electrical systems. Star, or Y, configuration connects one end of each 
component to a common point, forming a Y shape, while delta connects the 
components in a triangular loop. These configurations can be interchanged using 
specific formulas to simplify circuit analysis. Conversions between star and 
delta are particularly important in electrical engineering to analyze power 
distribution systems and ensure proper load balancing in three-phase circuits.
 Kirchhoff’s law
Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) states that in any closed-loop circuit, the sum of 
the potential differences (voltages) is zero. This law is essential for 
analyzing energy conservation within circuits. Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), on 
the other hand, asserts that the total current entering a junction equals the 
total current leaving it. These laws are cornerstones of circuit theory, 
enabling engineers to analyze and design complex electrical networks 
systematically.
 linear and non-linear circuit
Circuits can be classified based on the relationship between voltage and 
current. In linear circuits, this relationship is directly proportional, making 
them predictable and easy to analyze. Examples include circuits with resistors 
and capacitors. Non-linear circuits, such as those involving diodes or 
transistors, do not have a proportional relationship between voltage and 
current. Understanding these distinctions is crucial in modern electronics, 
where non-linear components play a central role in devices like amplifiers and 
signal processors.
 bilateral and unilateral circuits
Bilateral circuits allow current to flow equally well in both directions, making 
their behavior symmetric regardless of the current's direction. Examples include 
circuits with resistors or capacitors. Unilateral circuits, however, permit 
current to flow in only one direction, as seen in components like diodes. These 
classifications are significant in designing circuits for specific 
functionalities, such as rectifiers or filters.
 active and passive circuits
Active circuits contain components like voltage sources or transistors that can 
inject energy into the circuit, enabling signal amplification or oscillation. 
Passive circuits, by contrast, consist solely of elements like resistors, 
capacitors, and inductors that consume energy but do not generate it. These 
distinctions are foundational in understanding how circuits operate and are 
applied in everything from simple filters to complex electronic devices.

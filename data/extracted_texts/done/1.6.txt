1.6 Amplifiers:
Classification of Output Stages
Amplifiers are classified into various output stages based on their operating 
conditions, efficiency, and distortion characteristics:
Class A amplifiers are known for their linearity and low signal distortion 
because the active device conducts for the entire 360째 of the input cycle. 
However, their inefficiency arises from continuous power dissipation in the 
output device, even during idle operation. These amplifiers are commonly used in 
low-power audio amplification where signal fidelity is critical.
Class B amplifiers improve efficiency by using two transistors, each conducting 
for half the cycle (180째). The push-pull configuration reduces power wastage but 
introduces crossover distortion at the zero-crossing point of the waveform. This 
distortion makes Class B amplifiers unsuitable for high-quality audio 
applications without additional circuitry.
Class AB amplifiers bridge the gap between Classes A and B by slightly biasing 
both transistors to conduct for a little over 180째. This design minimizes 
crossover distortion while achieving better efficiency than Class A. Due to this 
balance, Class AB amplifiers are extensively used in audio power amplification.
Class C amplifiers, in contrast, conduct for less than 180째 of the input cycle. 
This mode significantly enhances efficiency but generates high levels of 
distortion. As a result, Class C amplifiers are limited to RF and high-frequency 
applications where signal fidelity is less critical, and the focus is on power 
efficiency.
Class A Output Stage
The Class A output stage operates with the active device (usually a transistor) 
biased in such a way that it remains in the active region throughout the entire 
input signal cycle. This ensures continuous conduction and minimizes distortion. 
However, this continuous operation results in high power loss as heat, leading 
to poor efficiency. Heat sinks are often employed to manage thermal dissipation. 
Despite its inefficiency, the Class A output stage is valued for its high 
fidelity and is commonly used in audio amplifiers and small-signal applications 
requiring minimal distortion.
Class B Output Stage
The Class B output stage addresses the inefficiency of Class A by utilizing two 
complementary transistors in a push-pull configuration. Each transistor handles 
one-half of the input waveform, effectively halving the power dissipation 
compared to Class A. However, the abrupt switching between the transistors at 
the zero-crossing introduces crossover distortion. To mitigate this issue, Class 
AB amplifiers, which maintain slight conduction overlap, are preferred in audio 
applications.
Class AB Output Stage
Class AB amplifiers operate with transistors biased slightly above cutoff, 
ensuring that both transistors conduct during the zero-crossing of the waveform. 
This overlap eliminates the crossover distortion inherent in Class B designs 
while retaining much of the efficiency advantage. The design involves careful 
biasing, often using diodes or temperature-compensating circuits, to maintain 
stability and minimize thermal drift. Class AB amplifiers are ubiquitous in 
audio power amplification, offering an excellent compromise between fidelity and 
efficiency.
Biasing the Class AB Stage
The Class AB stage requires precise biasing to achieve optimal performance. The 
bias voltage ensures that the transistors remain slightly conductive during the 
zero-crossing of the input signal, preventing distortion. This bias voltage is 
typically set using a combination of diodes, resistors, and thermistors to 

maintain temperature stability. Improper biasing can lead to thermal runaway, 
distortion, or inefficiency, underscoring the importance of careful design and 
implementation.
Power BJTs 
Power bipolar junction transistors are designed to handle high currents and 
voltages, making them essential for power amplifiers and switching applications. 
They feature a robust construction with large junction areas to manage heat 
dissipation effectively. Power BJTs operate in the active region for 
amplification and the saturation or cutoff regions for switching. Their 
performance is characterized by parameters like current gain, thermal 
resistance, and switching speed. Applications include motor drives, inverters, 
and power supplies.
Transformer-Coupled Push-Pull Stages
In transformer-coupled push-pull amplifiers, the output stage uses a transformer 
to combine the outputs of two transistors operating in push-pull mode. The 
transformer provides impedance matching between the amplifier and the load, 
improving power transfer efficiency. This configuration reduces even-order 
harmonics, enhancing the fidelity of the amplified signal. Although widely used 
in early audio amplifiers, transformer coupling has been largely replaced by 
modern designs due to its bulk and potential bandwidth limitations.
Tuned Amplifiers
Tuned amplifiers are specialized circuits designed to amplify signals at a 
specific frequency or within a narrow frequency band. These amplifiers 
incorporate resonant LC circuits in their design to achieve high selectivity and 
gain at the desired frequency. Tuned amplifiers are extensively used in 
communication systems, such as radio and TV receivers, to filter and amplify 
specific signals while rejecting noise and interference. Their performance 
depends on factors like quality factor (Q), bandwidth, and stability.
Op-Amps
Operational amplifiers are highly versatile electronic components used in a 
myriad of analog applications. They feature high open-loop gain, high input 
impedance, and low output impedance, making them ideal for signal amplification 
and processing. Op-amps can be configured in various ways, such as inverting and 
non-inverting amplifiers, integrators, differentiators, and voltage followers. 
They are integral to analog computing, active filters, oscillators, and 
instrumentation. Modern op-amps are implemented as integrated circuits, offering 
excellent performance and reliability in compact packages.

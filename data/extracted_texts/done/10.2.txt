10.2 Engineering Economics
Engineering economics is a specialized branch of economics that applies economic principles
to engineering decision-making. It helps engineers evaluate the financial feasibility of projects,
optimize resource allocation, and assess the long-term economic impact of technical solutions.
One of the fundamental aspects of engineering economics is understanding project cash flow,
which involves analyzing the inflow and outflow of money over a project's duration. A positive
cash flow indicates that a project is financially sustainable, while a negative cash flow may
suggest the need for financial restructuring.
The discount rate, interest, and time value of money are essential concepts in engineering
economics. The discount rate is the rate used to convert future cash flows into present value,
considering factors like inflation and opportunity cost. Interest represents the cost of borrowing
money or the return on investment, and it can be categorized into simple interest, where interest
is calculated on the principal amount, and compound interest, where interest is accrued on both
the principal and accumulated interest over time. The time value of money states that a certain
amount of money today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential
earning capacity.
Several methodologies are used for economic analysis in engineering projects. The discounted
payback period measures the time required to recover the initial investment while considering
the time value of money. The net present value (NPV) method calculates the total present worth
of future cash flows, determining whether a project is financially viable. A positive NPV
indicates profitability, while a negative NPV suggests a loss. The internal rate of return (IRR) is
the discount rate at which the NPV of a project becomes zero, serving as a useful metric for
comparing different investment opportunities. The minimum attractive rate of return (MARR) is
the lowest rate of return that an investor or organization is willing to accept for a project to be
considered viable.
Comparison of alternatives involves selecting the best project or investment option based on
financial, technical, and operational criteria. This process includes cost-benefit analysis, life
cycle cost analysis, and break-even analysis. Depreciation is another critical factor in
engineering economics, representing the reduction in value of assets over time. Various
depreciation methods, such as straight-line depreciation, declining balance depreciation, and
sum-of-the-yearsâ€™ digits, are used to calculate asset depreciation in Nepal. The taxation system
in Nepal includes income tax, corporate tax, and value-added tax (VAT), all of which impact
project budgeting and financial planning.

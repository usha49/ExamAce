4.6 Hardware description language and IC technology:
VHDL Overview:
VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) is a high-level language used to 
model and simulate digital systems. Developed in the 1980s as part of the U.S. 
Department of Defenseâ€™s VHSIC (Very High-Speed Integrated Circuits) program, 
VHDL allows designers to describe hardware at various abstraction levels, 
including behavioral, dataflow, and structural.
VHDL supports:
Simulation: Testing and verifying digital designs before implementation.
Synthesis: Translating the high-level description into a gate-level design for 
implementation on FPGAs or ASICs.
Portability: Designs can be reused across different hardware platforms.
VHDL designs are written in entities and architectures:
Entity: Defines the interface of the digital module, including input and output 
ports.
Architecture: Describes the internal behavior or structure of the module.
Example of a simple VHDL entity for an AND gate:
entity AND_Gate is
  Port ( A : in STD_LOGIC;
         B : in STD_LOGIC;
         Y : out STD_LOGIC);
end AND_Gate;
Overflow:
Overflow occurs in digital arithmetic when the result of an operation exceeds 
the range that can be represented by the available number of bits. This issue is 
critical in designs involving fixed-point and signed arithmetic.
Signed Overflow: Happens when the result of a signed operation exceeds the range 
defined by the number of bits.
Unsigned Overflow: Occurs when an operation on unsigned numbers produces a carry 
beyond the most significant bit (MSB).
In VHDL, overflow detection can be implemented using:
Carry Detection: For unsigned operations.
Sign Bit Analysis: For signed operations, where the sign bit of the result 
differs unexpectedly from the expected sign.
Example of detecting overflow in VHDL:
signal overflow: STD_LOGIC;
overflow <= (A(MSB) and B(MSB) and not Sum(MSB)) or
            (not A(MSB) and not B(MSB) and Sum(MSB));
Data representation using VHDL:
VHDL provides robust mechanisms for representing and manipulating data types, 
including:
Scalar Types: Represent individual values, such as BIT, STD_LOGIC, INTEGER, and 
REAL.
Composite Types: Include arrays and records for grouping multiple values.
Enumeration Types: Allow custom-defined values, like STATE_TYPE with values 
IDLE, READ, and WRITE.
Signed and Unsigned Types: Represent binary numbers for arithmetic operations. 
The SIGNED type supports signed arithmetic, while UNSIGNED is for non-negative 
numbers.
Example of using signed numbers in VHDL:
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
use IEEE.NUMERIC_STD.ALL;
signal A, B, Result: SIGNED(7 downto 0);
Result <= A + B; -- Signed addition
Design of combinational and sequential logic using VHDL

VHDL enables the design of both combinational and sequential circuits:
Combinational Logic:
Combinational circuits have outputs that depend solely on the current inputs. 
Common examples include multiplexers, decoders, and arithmetic units.
Example: 4-to-1 Multiplexer in VHDL:
entity MUX4 is
  Port ( A, B, C, D : in STD_LOGIC;
         S          : in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(1 downto 0);
         Y          : out STD_LOGIC);
end MUX4;
architecture Behavioral of MUX4 is
begin
  Y <= A when S = "00" else
       B when S = "01" else
       C when S = "10" else
       D;
end Behavioral;
Sequential Logic:
Sequential circuits depend on current inputs and the state of the system, often 
requiring flip-flops or registers.
Example: D Flip-Flop in VHDL:
entity D_FlipFlop is
  Port ( D, CLK : in STD_LOGIC;
         Q      : out STD_LOGIC);
end D_FlipFlop;
architecture Behavioral of D_FlipFlop is
begin
  process(CLK)
  begin
    if rising_edge(CLK) then
      Q <= D;
    end if;
  end process;
end Behavioral;
Pipelining using VHDL
Pipelining is a technique used to improve the throughput of digital systems by 
dividing a process into multiple stages, each handled by a separate hardware 
module. Pipelining is widely used in CPUs, signal processors, and communication 
systems.
Key steps in implementing pipelining in VHDL:
Partitioning the Design: Divide the process into distinct stages with 
intermediate registers.
Synchronizing Stages: Use a clock signal to synchronize data flow between 
stages.
Balancing Latency: Ensure each stage has approximately equal delay to optimize 
throughput.
Example: Pipelined Adder in VHDL:
entity Pipelined_Adder is
  Port ( A, B : in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0);
         CLK  : in STD_LOGIC;
         SUM  : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0));
end Pipelined_Adder;
architecture Behavioral of Pipelined_Adder is
  signal stage1, stage2: STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0);
begin
  process(CLK)
  begin
    if rising_edge(CLK) then

      stage1 <= A + B;         -- First stage
      stage2 <= stage1;        -- Second stage
    end if;
  end process;
  SUM <= stage2;               -- Final output
end Behavioral;
Pipelining improves the design's overall throughput but introduces latency, as 
data must pass through all stages before producing the final output.

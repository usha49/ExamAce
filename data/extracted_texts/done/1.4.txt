1.4 Semiconductor devices:
Semiconductor diode and its characteristics
A semiconductor diode is a two-terminal electronic device made from a p-n 
junction, where one side is doped with acceptor atoms (p-type) and the other 
with donor atoms (n-type). This configuration allows current to flow primarily 
in one direction, making it a key component in rectification processes. The 
diode exhibits distinct characteristics:
Forward Bias: When the p-side is connected to the positive terminal of a voltage 
source and the n-side to the negative terminal, the diode allows current flow. 
The voltage required to overcome the barrier potential is typically 0.7 V for 
silicon and 0.3 V for germanium.
Reverse Bias: When the polarity is reversed, the diode blocks current flow 
except for a negligible leakage current. However, beyond a certain reverse 
voltage, known as the breakdown voltage, the diode conducts heavily, which may 
damage it unless it is designed for such conditions (e.g., Zener diodes).
Semiconductor diodes are fundamental in power conversion, signal demodulation, 
and protection circuits.
BJT Configuration and biasing
The bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a three-layer semiconductor device 
consisting of two p-n junctions. BJTs are classified as either NPN or PNP types, 
depending on the arrangement of the layers. BJTs operate in three regions: 
active, saturation, and cutoff. They are configured in three common modes:
Common Emitter: Provides high gain and is widely used in amplification.
Common Base: Offers low input impedance and high-frequency operation.
Common Collector (Emitter Follower): Used for impedance matching due to high 
input and low output impedance.
Proper biasing is critical to ensure that the BJT operates in the desired 
region. This involves applying a DC voltage or current to the base terminal 
relative to the emitter and collector. Biasing methods include fixed bias, 
voltage-divider bias, and emitter bias, each suited for specific applications to 
stabilize the transistor's operation.
Small and large signal model
The small-signal model of a BJT simplifies the analysis of its behavior in 
amplifying weak signals. It uses equivalent circuit parameters, such as 
transconductance and output resistance, to represent the transistor's linear 
region of operation. The large-signal model, on the other hand, is used to 
analyze the transistor's behavior when significant variations in current and 
voltage occur, such as in switching applications. These models are indispensable 
in designing and analyzing amplifiers, oscillators, and other analog circuits.
Working principle of MOSFET
The metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) is a voltage-
controlled device widely used in analog and digital circuits. It consists of 
four terminals: gate, source, drain, and body. The MOSFET operates by 
controlling the flow of current between the drain and source terminals through 
an electric field induced by the voltage applied to the gate terminal. The 
device operates in three regions: cutoff, linear, and saturation. In the cutoff 
region, the MOSFET is off, and no current flows. In the linear region, it acts 
as a variable resistor. In the saturation region, it operates as a current 
source. MOSFETs are characterized by high input impedance, fast switching, and 
low power consumption.
Working principle of CMOS
Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology combines NMOS and PMOS 
transistors in a complementary arrangement to form logic gates and other 
circuits. The principle of operation relies on the complementary switching 

behavior of NMOS and PMOS transistors. When one transistor is on, the other is 
off, ensuring minimal power consumption. This characteristic makes CMOS the 
preferred technology for integrated circuits, particularly in digital 
applications. The low static power dissipation and high noise immunity of CMOS 
circuits contribute to their widespread adoption in microprocessors, memory 
devices, and application-specific integrated circuits.
Application of MOSFET
MOSFETs are versatile devices with a broad range of applications, including 
power electronics, signal amplification, and switching. In power applications, 
MOSFETs are used in DC-DC converters, inverters, and motor control circuits due 
to their high efficiency and fast switching capabilities. In analog circuits, 
they serve as amplifiers and variable resistors, while in digital circuits, 
MOSFETs act as the building blocks of logic gates and memory cells.
Application of CMOS
CMOS technology is integral to modern electronics, finding applications in both 
digital and analog domains. In digital circuits, CMOS is used in 
microprocessors, microcontrollers, and digital signal processors due to its low 
power consumption and high integration density. Analog CMOS circuits are 
employed in mixed-signal applications, such as data converters, operational 
amplifiers, and filters. The combination of low cost, high efficiency, and 
scalability makes CMOS a cornerstone of semiconductor technology.

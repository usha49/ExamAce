Introduction to Data Structure, Lists, Linked Lists, and Trees
Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science that help in organizing and
storing data efficiently. They provide a structured way to manage and manipulate data, enabling
efficient searching, sorting, and retrieval. Data structures can be broadly categorized into linear
and non-linear types, each designed for specific operations and use cases.
Data types define the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program.
Primitive data types include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans. Data
structures, on the other hand, refer to the organization and storage format of data, facilitating
efficient access and modification. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees,
and graphs. Abstract Data Types (ADTs) define logical data structures without specifying their
implementation details. ADTs include lists, stacks, queues, and trees, which specify the
operations that can be performed rather than how they are implemented in memory.
The efficiency of an algorithm is measured in terms of time and space complexity. Time
complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of the input
size. It is expressed using asymptotic notation such as Big-O, which represents the worst-case
scenario, Omega, which represents the best-case scenario, and Theta, which represents the
average-case scenario. Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires
for execution, including both fixed and variable memory allocations. Analyzing these
complexities helps in selecting the most efficient algorithm for solving a problem.
Linear data structures store data sequentially. Examples include stacks and queues. A stack
follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning elements are added and removed from
the top. The main operations performed on a stack include inserting an element at the top,
removing the top element, retrieving the top element without removing it, and checking if the
stack is empty. Stacks are widely used in function calls, recursion, undo operations in text
editors, and expression evaluation.
A queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning elements are added at the rear
and removed from the front. The main operations performed on a queue include inserting an
element at the rear, removing an element from the front, and checking if the queue is empty.
Queues are commonly used in scheduling tasks, handling requests in operating systems, and
managing buffers.

Stacks are particularly useful in expression evaluation. Infix expressions, where operators
appear between operands (e.g., A + B), can be converted into postfix notation (e.g., AB+) using
stacks. Operators are pushed onto a stack while operands are directly placed in the output. In
postfix evaluation, the operands appear before the operator, making computation
straightforward using a stack. The operands are pushed onto the stack, and whenever an
operator is encountered, the required number of operands is popped, the operation is performed,
and the result is pushed back.
Lists can be implemented using arrays or linked structures. An array-based implementation
stores elements in a fixed-size sequential block of memory, whereas a linked list dynamically
allocates memory. Stacks and queues can also be implemented as lists, where stacks allow
only push and pop operations at one end, while queues allow insertion at the rear and removal
from the front.
A static list structure has a fixed size, meaning memory is allocated at the time of declaration
and cannot be changed later. Examples include arrays. A dynamic list structure allows memory
allocation and deallocation as needed. Linked lists are an example of dynamic list structures,
where elements (nodes) can be added or removed without predefined constraints on size.
A linked list consists of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in
the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists provide dynamic memory allocation, allowing flexible
modifications.
Basic operations on linked lists include creating a linked list, inserting nodes at different
positions, and deleting nodes from different positions. Insertion can be done at the beginning,
middle, or end of the list. Deletion can be performed by removing nodes from specific positions.
Doubly linked lists are particularly useful in applications requiring bidirectional traversal, such as
 navigation in web browsers and undo-redo operations in text editors.
There are different types of linked lists. A singly linked list consists of nodes where each node
points to the next node in the sequence. A doubly linked list contains two pointers, one pointing
to the next node and another pointing to the previous node, allowing bidirectional traversal. A
circular linked list is where the last node of the list points back to the first node, creating a
circular connection. Circular linked lists can be singly or doubly linked.

A tree is a hierarchical, non-linear data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. The
top node is called the root, and every node can have child nodes. Trees are widely used in
database indexing, file systems, artificial intelligence, and hierarchical data representation.
A binary tree is a type of tree where each node has at most two children. Operations in a binary
tree include insertion, deletion, and searching. Insertion involves adding a new node while
maintaining the tree structure. Searching is performed to find whether a specific element exists
within the tree. Deletion removes a node while restructuring the tree to maintain its properties.
Traversal in binary trees is done using different methods. Pre-order traversal visits the root node
first, then recursively visits the left subtree followed by the right subtree. Post-order traversal
visits the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and finally the root node. In-order traversal
visits the left subtree first, then the root node, and finally the right subtree. These traversal
techniques are used in applications such as expression tree evaluation and hierarchical data
processing.
The height of a tree is the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. The level of a node
represents the depth at which it exists in the tree, with the root being at level zero. The depth of
a node is the number of edges from the root node to that specific node.
An AVL tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between
the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one. If the balance factor of any node exceeds
this limit, rotations are performed to restore balance. AVL trees are used in applications
requiring efficient searching and sorting, such as database indexing and memory management.

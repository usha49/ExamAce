Which of the following best describes the relationship between query optimization and query decomposition?,"['They are entirely separate processes.', 'Query decomposition is a specific technique within query optimization.', 'Query optimization is a subset of query decomposition.', 'They are contradictory approaches to query processing.']",B,Query decomposition is a technique employed within the broader process of query optimization to improve query performance.,Query Decomposition,Medium,7.3

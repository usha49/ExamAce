What is the primary function of an interrupt in a microprocessor system?,"[""To permanently halt the processor's current operation."", 'To request immediate attention from the processor for a specific task.', 'To sequentially process tasks in a predefined order.', ""To enhance the speed of the processor's clock cycle.""]",B,"Interrupts signal the processor to handle a request immediately, interrupting its current operation to service the request.",Interrupt,Easy,2.6
How does interrupt handling improve the efficiency of microprocessor operations?,"['By increasing the clock speed of the processor.', 'By allowing the processor to handle real-time tasks efficiently.', ""By simplifying the processor's instruction set."", 'By reducing the amount of memory required for program execution.']",B,"Interrupt handling allows the processor to respond to time-sensitive events without significant delays, improving real-time task management.",Interrupt,Medium,2.6
What initiates an interrupt signal?,"['Only internal components of the processor.', 'Only external peripheral devices.', 'Either a peripheral device or an internal component.', 'The operating system exclusively.']",C,Interrupts can originate from both internal components within the processor or external peripheral devices.,Interrupt,Easy,2.6
What is the significance of interrupts in handling real-time events?,"['Interrupts delay the processing of real-time events.', 'Interrupts have no impact on real-time event processing.', 'Interrupts allow immediate responses to real-time events.', 'Interrupts prevent real-time events from being processed.']",C,"Interrupts are crucial for timely responses to real-time events, ensuring prompt attention to critical tasks.",Interrupt,Easy,2.6
What is the primary function of an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)?,"[""To initiate a program's execution."", 'To handle interrupt requests.', 'To manage memory allocation.', ""To control the processor's clock speed.""]",B,The ISR is specifically designed to respond to and process interrupt requests.,Interrupt Service Routine,Easy,2.6
"Before executing an ISR, what crucial step does the processor typically perform to ensure proper program resumption?","['It increases the clock speed.', 'It deallocates memory.', 'It saves the contents of key registers.', 'It initiates a system shutdown.']",C,"Saving register contents (like the program counter) preserves the program's execution state, allowing it to resume seamlessly after the ISR completes.",Interrupt Service Routine,Medium,2.6
What are two common methods for implementing interrupt handling?,"['Serial and parallel', 'Synchronous and asynchronous', 'Vectored and non-vectored', 'Hardware and software']",C,The passage explicitly mentions vectored and non-vectored interrupts as implementation methods.,Interrupt Service Routine,Easy,2.6
"After the completion of an ISR, what action restores the interrupted program's execution?","['Rebooting the system.', 'Restoring saved register values.', 'Clearing the interrupt flag.', 'Running a system diagnostic.']",B,Restoring saved register values is essential for resuming the interrupted program from where it left off.,Interrupt Service Routine,Medium,2.6
What component's contents are typically saved before transferring control to an ISR?,"['The memory cache', 'The hard drive', 'The program counter and status registers', 'The input/output buffers']",C,The passage states that the program counter and status registers are saved to preserve the execution state before ISR execution.,Interrupt Service Routine,Easy,2.6
What is the primary purpose of saving the program counter (PC) and status registers during interrupt processing?,"['To increase processing speed.', 'To prevent data corruption.', 'To preserve the execution state of the interrupted program.', 'To allow for multitasking.']",C,Saving the PC and status registers allows the processor to resume execution of the interrupted program from where it left off after the interrupt service routine (ISR) completes.,Interrupt Processing,Medium,2.6
What is an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)?,"['A hardware component that detects interrupts.', 'A predefined set of instructions that handles interrupt requests.', 'A software program that schedules interrupts.', 'A method for prioritizing interrupts.']",B,An ISR is a specific routine executed to handle an interrupt event.,Interrupt Processing,Easy,2.6
Which of the following is NOT a method for implementing interrupt handling?,"['Vectored interrupts', 'Non-vectored interrupts', 'Polling interrupts', 'Scheduled interrupts']",D,"While polling is a related concept,  vectored and non-vectored interrupts are the main methods discussed in interrupt handling. Scheduled interrupts are not a standard interrupt handling method.",Interrupt Processing,Medium,2.6
"After executing the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR), what crucial step must the processor take to ensure proper program execution?","[' Halt execution.', ' Restart the system.', 'Restore the previously saved register values.', ' Clear the interrupt flag.']",C,Restoring the saved register values is essential to resume the interrupted program from its previous state.,Interrupt Processing,Easy,2.6
What component is primarily responsible for initiating the interrupt handling process?,"['The operating system', 'The interrupt service routine (ISR)', 'The program counter (PC)', 'An interrupt request (IRQ) signal']",D,An interrupt request signal from a hardware device or software event triggers the interrupt handling process.,Interrupt Processing,Medium,2.6

Which of the following is NOT a common technique used for process synchronization?,"['Atomic Operations', 'Semaphores', 'Thread Pools', 'Barriers']",C,"Thread pools are a way to manage threads, not a direct synchronization mechanism.  Atomic operations, barriers, and semaphores are all techniques for synchronization.",Classical Problems of Synchronization,Medium,7.5
"In the context of process synchronization, what does a ""barrier"" achieve?","['It prevents processes from accessing shared memory.', 'It allows processes to proceed only after all have reached a certain point.', 'It increases the speed of concurrent processing.', 'It creates a deadlock condition.']",B,Barriers synchronize processes by making them wait until all have reached a specific point in the execution before continuing.,Classical Problems of Synchronization,Easy,7.5
What characteristic defines an atomic operation?,"['It can be interrupted by other processes.', 'It operates only on a single processor.', 'It executes without interruption.', 'It is only used for memory allocation.']",C,Atomic operations are indivisible and guaranteed to execute completely without interference from other processes.,Classical Problems of Synchronization,Easy,7.5
The formula  ð ð   =ð 1+ð ð    ð ¦ð ð â /ð Tsâ  (assuming correct notation) likely represents what aspect of parallel processing?,"['The optimal number of processors for a given task.', 'The memory allocation strategy.', 'The impact of synchronization overhead on execution time.', 'The speedup achieved by using multiple threads.']",C,"The formula suggests a relationship between execution time on a single processor, synchronization overhead, and the number of processors, indicating the effect of synchronization on the total execution time.",Classical Problems of Synchronization,Medium,7.5

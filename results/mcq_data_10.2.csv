What does a higher discount rate generally imply for the present value of a future cash flow?,"['Higher present value', 'Lower present value', 'No effect on present value', ' It depends on the inflation rate']",B,A higher discount rate reduces the present value of a future cash flow because it reflects a higher opportunity cost or risk.,"Discount rate, interest and time value of money",Medium,10.2
